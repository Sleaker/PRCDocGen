<br>To enable builders to integrate the PRC into their modules better, a series of
common scripts that the PRC overrides have had additional scripts added via
ExecuteScript. These are:
<br>
<br>nw_c2_default7 (NPC OnDeath) runs a script named "prc_pwondeath" This is designed
for custom XP use and all the normal OnDeath functions will work as usual.
<br>
<br>nw_s0_raisdead (spell script for raise dead) runs a script named "prc_pw_raisedead"
This is designed for persistent death scripts. You can get the raised creature with
GetSpellTargetObject().
<br>
<br>nw_s0_ressurec (spell script for ressurection) runs a script named
"prc_pw_ressurection" This is designed for persistent death scripts. You can get the
resurrected creature with GetSpellTargetObject().
<br>
<br>ss_ep_cont_resur (spell script for contingent ressurection) runs a script named
"prc_pw_contress" This is designed for persistent death scripts. You can get the raised
creature with OBJECT_SELF.
<br>
<br>ss_ep_armyunfall (spell script for army unfallen) runs a script named
"prc_pw_armyunfall" This is designed for persistent death scripts. You can get the
raised creature with OBJECT_SELF.
<br>
<br>psi_inc_psifunc AstralSeedRespawn() (function for astral seed psionic power ondeath)
runs a script named "prc_pw_astralseed" This is designed for persistent death scripts.
You can get the raised creature with OBJECT_SELF.
<br>
<br>x0_i0_spells (spell include for many things including petrification) runs a script
named "prc_pw_petrific" This is designed for persistent death scripts. You can get the
petrified creature with OBJECT_SELF. Note: this will only be run if on hard core rules or very difficult, since on other settings petrification is temporary.
<br>
<br>x0_s0_stoflesh (spell script for stone to flesh) runs a script named
"prc_pw_unpetrif" This is designed for persistent death scripts. You can get the
unpetrified creature with OBJECT_SELF. Note: this will only be run if on hard core rules or very difficult, since on other settings petrification is temporary.
<br>
<br>Remember however that the PRC has added code switches for some of the common PW scripts
including persistant death tracking.
