<div class="div_paddedcontent">
<br>There is a very simple respawning door system included in PRC v3.1 or higher. It consists of two scripts,
door_destroyed and door_ud. Simply put the door_ud script in a doors OnUserDefinedEvents script
slot, and put door_destroyed in OnDeath slot. See the picture below as an example

<br>
<br>If you want the door to respawn after a certain time, enter the number of minutes into the
will save throw. Then once that time has elapsed, the door will respawn.
<br>If you want to manually controll the door respawning, leave the will saving throw at zero.
Then when you want the door to respawn, use the SignalEvent command to send a User Defined event
number 500 to the door. You may want to refer to the lexicon for information about these commands.
<br><br>
Note: if the door is trapped and or locked the trap/lock will not respawn with the door.
You can use the CreateTrapOnObject() function to add a trap, and SetLocked() to lock the door.
