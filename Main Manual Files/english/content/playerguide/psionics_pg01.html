<br>Psionics is a similar system to conventional spellcasting, however there are a number of important points that separate them.

<br>Most of the terms that refer to spells have direct equivalents in psionics.<ul>
    <li>A <i><b>psionic character</b></i> is one that has a <i><b>power point</b></i> reserve.</li>
	<li>Psionic spells are called <i><b>powers</b></i>.</li>
	<li>Metamagic-type abilities are called <i><b>metapsionics</b></i>.</li>
	<li>A character than can use psionic powers is a <i><b>manifester</b></i> and powers are used at a certain <i><b>manifester level</b></i> instead of caster level.</li>
	<li>Powers are divided into 9 <i><b>power levels</b></i> (I to IX) in the same way spells are divided into spell levels. However, there are no psionic cantrips.</li>
	<li>Like spells, powers are separated into groups, however, instead of schools they are referred to as <i><b>disciplines</b></i> and are:<ul>
		<li>Psychometabolism. A Psion specialising in it is known as an Egoist.</li>
		<li>Psychokinesis.    A Psion specialising in it is known as a Kineticist.</li>
		<li>Psychoportation.  A Psion specialising in it is known as a Nomad.</li>
		<li>Clairsentience.   A Psion specialising in it is known as a Seer.</li>
		<li>Metacreativity.   A Psion specialising in it is known as a Shaper.</li>
		<li>Telepathy.        A Psion specialising in it is known as a Telepath.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Resistance to powers is called <i><b>power resistance</b></i> and is interchangeable with spell resistance. Power resistance also resists spells and spell resistance also resists powers. *</li>
	<li>As with spells, most offensive powers have a saving throw to avoid or reduce their effects. The DC on the power is normally 10 + relevant ability modifier + power level. Certain other abilities such as feats can alter the DC as well.</li>
	<li>The 3 main psionic base classes have approximate equivalent spellcasting classes. <i><b>Psions</b></i> are similar to wizards, <i><b>Wilders</b></i> are similar to sorcerers, and <i><b>Psychic Warriors</b></i> are similar to a combination of bards and paladins/rangers.</li>
	<li>As with divine casters, manifesters are not affected by wearing armor or using a shield. However, psions are not proficient with shields or any type of armor, and wilders are only proficient with light armor and shields. Manifesters can use feats or multi-classing to become proficient, as normal.</li>
	<li>Many powers function identically to spell equivalents, for example charm, daze, dimension door, dimensional anchor, disintegrate, dismissal, dominate, freedom of movement, keen edge, knock, mind blank, restoration, true seeing, and others. There are other powers that function very similarly to certain spells.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    * The distinction between Power Resistance and Spell Resistance is purely nomenclatural in the version of the ruleset used by the PRC psionics implementation (full transparency). As such, the term only appears in the power descriptions and some feedback text. For example, the actual effect of the power <i>Power Resistance</i> is to grant 12 + manifester level of Spell Resistance.
