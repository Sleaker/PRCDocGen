<br>An important part of effectivly using psionics is augmentation. This means that by spending additional power points over and above the base points required by a power you can magnify the power's effects. Most powers can be augmented in only one way, however a few can be augmented to two or more different results. The amount of power points you have to spend for each augmentation varies depending on the power.
<br>
<br><center><b>Remember, you cannot spend more power points on a single power than your manifester level.</b></center>
<br>
<br>This includes the additional costs from augmentation and/or metapsionics. However, abilities that increase your manifester level also increase the maximum number of power points you can spend, for example Overchannel.
<br>
<br>Augmentation is controlled by a number of profiles. Switching between profiles happens instantly and it effects powers from that moment onwards. On the main augmentation subradial, there are 3 quickslots, "augmentation off", and augmentation options.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>The quickslots each have an augmentation profile associated with them. These profiles can be edited through the augmentation options.
<br>
<br>"Augmentation off" has a fixed profile associated with it that has zero for all augmentation options. Thus when selected, you will only pay the base point points, plus any metapsionics.
<br>
<br>The other 3 augmentation subradials are used to select any of up to 50 pre-planned profiles. There is one subradial for 0-4, another for 5-9, and one for 00-40. The profile that is currently in use is the combined result of these three subradials.
<br>
<br>For example, by default you use profile 00. If you then select the "4" subradial, you will switch to profile 04.
<br>If you then press the "10" subradial, it will combine the "4" with the "10" and switch to profile 14.
<br>If you next select the "7" subradial, it will replace the "4" with "7" and combine that with the "10" to switch to profile 17.
