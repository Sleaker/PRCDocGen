<br><h4>NOTE: This document pertains to NWN1 v1.69 only, not NWN:Enhanced Edition! Please understand this before continuing.<br>
</h4>
<h4>The ConvoCC is still a work-in-progress. Please report any bugs and
issues you might have, after first checking that you have followed this
guide, that the issues have not already been fixed, and that it is a
reporoducable bug. Make sure you include as much information as
possible in reports, including at least what OS and database you are
running, where you got the ConvoCC from, what haks you are using, how
you precached the 2das, what character you are building, and exactly
what steps you take to expose the bug. A screenshot of the bug as well
as both the serverlog and NWNX-ODBC log files is also very helpful.
Without reliable feedback and reports, I cannot improve the ConvoCC.
Thank you for your cooperation.</h4>

<br>
<br>This is a step-by-step guide on how to install the PRC Server Pack.
<br>The PRC Server Pack is needed if you want to do any of the following:
<ul><li>Use the Conversation Character Creator. This allows the creation of
characters with new races, new classes or other custom content at level 1.
</li><li>Use the Letoscript enhancements for things such as permanent stat adjustments, etc.
</li><li>Use a database other than biowares to cache 2da information in.</li></ul>

<br>The system is composed of several components. Firstly, there is <a href="http:%5C%5Cwww.nwnx.org">NWNX2</a>.
This is an application that hooks into memory locations of the NWServer in order to pass information
into and out of the game. It relies on plugins to provide functionallity.
<br>
<br>Two plugins are included in the PRC Server Pack:
<br>One is a database plugin, <a href="http://www.nwnx.org/index.php?id=doc_odbc2">NWNX-ODBC2</a>, which is used
to access a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite database</a>.
<br>The other is the <a href="http://weathersong.infopop.cc/groupee/forums/a/frm/f/9616039431">NWNX-Letoscript</a> plugin <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=92983&amp;package_id=111517">build 24</a>.
<br>
<br>There is also a prechacher tool build-into prc.jar and a stand-alone SQLite commandline tool.
These are used to insert the 2da files into the database where they can be accessed quicker.
<br>
<br>Many servers may already have NWNX setup, possibly already using
NWNX-ODBC2 to provide database functionallity. Some servers use MySQL
instead of SQLite as a database. In these cases, the precacher can be
set to provide MySQL compatible syntax. (NOTE: I know little about
non-SQLite databases, so I dont know how well this works or any details
of it. If you have more information, please contact the PRC team so
this manual can be updated)
<br>
<br>
<br>The first step is to download the PRC Server Pack from
<a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&amp;id=7870">here</a>.
If your using windows, you should get the .exe installer.
<br>To install the PRC Server Pack, simply run the exe. It should automatically
detect your NWN directory. After it has installed itself, it will offer to precache
the 2das for you straght away.
<br>
<br>If you are using another OS there is a .rar version as well, which
should be extracted to your NWN directoy. Then you will need to
manually start the precaching by running the "precache sqlite.bat" file
(NOTE: I dont know anything about non-windows OS, so I dont know if a
batch file applies or not. If you have more information, please contact
the PRC team so this manual can be updated).
<br>
<br>If you are looking to add the ConvoCC to an existing server, then
you should use the method above (after making a full backup of course).
If your existing server uses MySQL, then you will have to use the rar
distribution and run "precache mysql.bat" instead. This will produce a
file named "out.sql" which you should then run through your database
tools. A command like "mysql -u USER -p DATABASENAME &lt; out.sql &gt;
out.log" (replace USER and DATABASENAME with the values you use) should
work. You may have to copy the out.sql file to wherever MySQL is
installed. (NOTE: I know little about non-SQLite databases, so I dont
know how well this works or any details of it. If you have more
information, please contact the PRC team so this manual can be updated)
<br>
<br>Once the precacher has finished, you should have a ready populated
database with all the 2da information in it. This is needed so that
SQL-queries can be used to retrieve lists of feats etc, rather than
lengthy loops over all the rows in the 2das.
<br>
<br>If you need to precache the 2da files again in the future, for
example a new PRC version is released, run the "precache sqlite.bat"
file (or "precache mysql.bat" if using MySQL and then process the
out.sql file as before) in your NWN directory. This will remove the
tables that the precacher previously added, so it should preserve any
other existing data. However, it is probably a good idea to make a
backup before you update, just to be save!
<br>
<br>Now that you have a populated database, you can go about setting up the ConvoCC
<br>This is done mainly through the switch system. The minimum switches that should
be set are:
<br><br><table class="table_contenttable" align="center" border="1" bordercolor="#6c6c6c" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr><td>PRC_CONVOCC_ENABLE</td><td>This enables the ConvoCC via the OnClientEnter event.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PRC_CONVOCC_USE_XP_FOR_NEW_CHAR</td><td>This uses zero XP on a character to mark them as new.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PRC_USE_DATABASE</td><td>Turn on database useage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PRC_DB_SQLLITE or PRC_DB_MYSQL</td><td>Set it to the correct SQL syntax.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PRC_USE_LETOSCRIPT</td><td>Turn on Letoscript.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PRC_LETOSCRIPT_NWN_DIR</td><td>A string pointing to your NWN installation directory.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>If you want further information on switches, see the prc_inc_switch script.
<br>
<br>
<br><h2>Symptom: Letoscript fails to find the NWN directory.</h2>
<br>Check the PRC_LETOSCRIPT_NWN_DIR switch. Try different slash options, / // \ \\ as well as having a trailing slash or not.
<br>Check you are using NWNX-Letoscipt <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=92983&amp;package_id=111517">build 24</a>
<br>
<br>
<br><h2>Symptom: Not all options are displayed on occasion</h2>
<br>This appears to be lag-related. Try selecting an option and then
responding "no" to the confirmation. This should re-generate the list
with all the options present, though it may take a few attempts.
<br>
<br>
<br><h2>Symptom: No options are present and the conversation cannot be aborted.</h2>
<br>This is usually the result of a bug, you can use Alt-F4 to quit NWN without using Ctr-Alt-Delete.
<br>Please report this including what OS and database you are running,
where you got the ConvoCC from, what haks you are using, how you
precached the 2das, what character you are building, and exactly what
steps you take to expose the bug.
