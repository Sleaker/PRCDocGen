<b>Q:</b> I get a message that the installer cant find NWN, HotU or
SoU.

<br><br><b>A:</b> The installer reads your registry entries, so if they are
wrong the installer wont work. The best bet is to uninstall and re-install NWN
and both expansions, that should restore the registry entries as well.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I get a message that I need the Microsoft .NET framework

<br><br><b>A:</b> The installer uses Microsoft .NET which you can get it <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21">here</a>

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I use linux and/or mac and can't use the installer

<br><br><b>A:</b> You can get the .rar version from the vault and extract it
by hand

<div><h2>PRC Module Updater</h2></div>
</a>
<br>

<b>Q:</b> Why cant I update Bioware premium modules?

<br><br><b>A:</b> Bioware has encrypted these, so the updater cannot read
them. Sorry, but there is nothing the PRC can do about it.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Why does the PRC not work with module "X"?

<br><br><b>A:</b> We cannot guarantee that the PRC is compatible with any
module. In general most modules can cope with the PRC being added with little or
no side effects, in particular we have tried to be as compatible as possible
with the Bioware original campaigns. Some known problems include any module with
Hardcore Rule set, arQon's EMS, Old Man Beards OHS, Spellman Project, as well as
some specific modules, such as Demon.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I get a message that I need the Microsoft .NET framework

<br><br><b>A:</b> The installer uses Microsoft .NET which you can get it <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21">here</a>

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I use linux and/or mac and can't use the module updater

<br><br><b>A:</b> Unfortunately, you will have to install it by hand into
modules. See the <a href="http://www.athasreborn.com/prc/">PRC Forums</a> and ask for more information
and assistance.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I get an warning message during the merge saying "...."

<br><br><b>A:</b> Most error messages warn about overridden scripts or 2da
conflicts, but a lot of the time the module will work anyway, even if there may
be one or two minor glitches in specific circumstances. If it is an error
message because of CEP, see the next question.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Does the PRC update modules with CEP added?

<br><br><b>A:</b> Yes, but there is an additional problem. After the module
updater has finished, you need to use the nwhak utility in the utilis folder of
your NWN install to extract a copy of baseitems.2da from the prc_2da.hak file,
and extract baseitems.2da from the merge file. Using a plain text editor (such
as notepad) you need to copy the first 112 lines (starting with "0&nbsp;&nbsp;
106&nbsp; shortsword ....." down to "112&nbsp;&nbsp; 83664&nbsp; craftbase
......" inclusive) from the PRC version over the same lines in the merge hak
version. Then you need to use nwhak to reinsert it into the merge hak.
Alternatively, you could try downloading one of the unofficial merge haks from
the vault and using that instead.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> This is an excellent utility. Can I use it for my own hak?

<br><br><b>A:</b> Yes, the .hif files are use to tell it what files to put
where and can be opened with a plain text editor (such as notepad). <br><br>

</a>

<br><b>Q:</b> It says it cant find the portrait directory.

<br><br><b>A:</b> You need a folder named "portraits" in your NWN directory,
though it doesn't need any files in it. It it doesn't exist, you'll need to
create it.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I am having problems using packages to select feats,
skills, spells etc.

<br><br><b>A:</b> There are some known bugs involving packages and the CC,
also almost all of the PRC classes do not have any packages. It is better to
hand-pick all your feats etc.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> None of the new PRC races and/or classes are showing up.

<br><br><b>A:</b> Make sure you have the .hak files associated correctly in
the "Settings" screen.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I get weird lines of text instead of names.

<br><br><b>A:</b> Make sure you have the .tlk file associates correctly in
the "Settings" screen.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I cant see any buttons or anything.

<br><br><b>A:</b> There have been reports of issues with ATI catalyst drivers
If you them update to 5.7 or later this problem should be fixed.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I don't know what head number corresponds to which head.

<br><br><b>A:</b> Use the toolset to place a creature and change its
appearance to your desire. Then note down the head number from the properties
and use that in the CC. This picture should help clarify it:

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I want to use CEP for my appearance.

<br><br><b>A:</b> Add CEP and a CEP &amp; PRC merge to the list of haks in the
"Settings" screen, and set the custom tlk file to a CEP &amp; PRC merged tlk file.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> I get an error message XYZ
<br><br><b>Q:</b> The java CC disapperes while loading

<br><br><b>A:</b> Try uninstalling java and WinRAR and following the exact
steps described in this document. If that still doesn't work you could try
making a batch file. To do so open notepad and type:

<br><br>java -Xmx150M -Xms150M -jar CC.jar

<br><br>Then save it as "cc.bat" (including the quote marks) in the
same directory as cc.jar and then run the batch file by double-clicking on it.

<div><h2>General Questions</h2></div>
</a>

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Why doesn't racial Spell Resistance show on the character sheet?

<br><br><b>A:</b> Because the PRC has a scripted SR system, to allow for various features.
You should see "X was affected by the spell." or similar messages.

<br><br><b>Q:</b> Why doesn't X show on the character sheet?

<br><br><b>A:</b> Because the character sheet is rather buggy. Additional attacks for example,
often do not show. However, the combat logs will be correct, so you can use those numbers to
measure your character against.
