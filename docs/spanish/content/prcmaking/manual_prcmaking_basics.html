We have recived several questions on the forums about the 2da's and basic scripting.
I felt I would try and help those new to custom content by providing links to the information.
<br><br>
For information on 2da's, harcoded limitations, etc. Check the
<a href="http://ccg.dladventures.com/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">Neverwinter Nights Custom Content Guide</a>.
<br><br>
For questions concerning scripting check out the
<a href="http://www.nwnlexicon.com/" target="_blank">NWN Lexicon</a>.
<br><br>
If you can not find what you are looking for there,
feel free to ask questions on the BioWare forums,
or of course our own forums.
