			<div>As a manifesters knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or learned. For example, a manifester can learn how to manifest a power so that it lasts longer than normal, deals more damage than normal, or is improved in some other way. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is more expensive than manifesting the power normally.
<br />  Manifesting Time: Powers manifested using metapsionic feats take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat description specifically says otherwise, such as with Quicken Power.
<br />  Manifestation Cost: To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic character must both expend his psionic focus and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat description. For example, applying the Chain Power feat to a power increases the power's cost by 6 power points.
<br />  Limits on Use: As with all powers, you cannot spend more power points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this rule.
<br />  Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power: In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at it's original power level, even though it costs additional power points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can't use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other device.
<br />Manifesting a power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
<br />Some metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.</div>
