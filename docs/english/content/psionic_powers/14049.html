<br />Level: Psychic warrior 1
<br />Manifesting Time: 1 swift action
<br />Range: Personal
<br />Target: You
<br />Duration: 1 hour/level
<br />Power Points: see text
<br />Metapsionics: Extend
<br />
<br />You call forth the aggressive nature of the beast inherent in yourself, psionically transforming your hands into deadly claws. You gain two natural attacks with your claws, each dealing 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if you are Large or larger, or 1d3 if you are Small or smaller) plus your Strength bonus.
<br />
<br />Your claws are natural weapons, so you are considered armed when attacking with them, and they can be affected by powers, spells, and effects that enhance or improve natural.
<br />
<br />Your claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can make an attack with one claw or a full attack with two claws at your normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine. You take no penalties for two-weapon fighting, and neither attack is a secondary attack. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks-you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus.
<br />
<br />You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power on your turn before you attack. Manifesting this power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round.
<br />
<br />You can still hold and manipulate items with your claws or cast spells just as well as you could with your hands.
<br />
<br />Augment: If you spend additional power points, you can create larger, sharper, and more deadly claws, as shown on the table below.
<br />
<br />Power Points    Claw Damage
<br />                Small   Medium  Large
<br />1               1d3     1d4     1d6
<br />3               1d4     1d6     1d8
<br />5               1d6     1d8     2d6
<br />7               1d8     2d6     3d6
<br />11              2d6     3d6     4d6
<br />15              3d6     4d6     5d6
<br />19              4d6     5d6     6d6
<br />
<br />This augmentation is implemented as the following two augmentation options:
<br />1. For every 2 power points spent, the size of the claws increases by one step on the table above. This increase may be used up to 3 times.
<br />2. For every 4 power points spent, the size of the claws increases by one step on the table above. This increase may be used up to 3 times.</div>
