			<div>Psychometabolism
<br />Level: Psychic warrior 4
<br />Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Range: Personal
<br />Target: You
<br />Duration: Concentration
<br />Power Points: 7
<br />Metapsionics: None
<br />
<br />You are almost impossible to move. Your weight does not vary; instead, you mentally attach yourself to the underlying fabric of the plane. You gain a +20 bonus on Discipline skill checks. You can't voluntarily move to a new location unless you stop concentrating, which ends the power.
<br />
<br />You cannot apply your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class; however, your anchored body gains damage reduction 15/-.
<br />
<br />You cannot make physical attacks or perform any other large-scale movements (you can make smallscale movements, such as breathing, turning your head, moving your eyes, talking, and so on). Powers with the teleportation descriptor manifested on you automatically fail.
<br />
<br />
<br />Implementation note: To end concentrating on the power, use the control feat again. If the power is active, that will end it instead of manifesting it.</div>
