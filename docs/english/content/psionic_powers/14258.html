<br />Level: Psychic warrior 1
<br />Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Range: Personal
<br />Target: You
<br />Duration: 1 round/level
<br />Power Points: 1
<br />Metapsionics: Extend
<br />
<br />This power causes instant diminution, halving your height, length, and width and dividing your weight by 8. This decrease changes your size category to the next smaller one. You gain a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a -2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum effective Strength score of 1), a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 size bonus to Armor Class due to your reduced size. This power doesn't change your speed.
<br />
<br />Multiple effects that reduce size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second manifestation of this power to further reduce yourself.
<br />
<br />Augment: You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.
<br />1. If you spend 6 additional power points, this power decreases your size by two size categories. You gain a +4 size bonus to Dexterity, a -4 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum effective Strength score of 1), a +2 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 size bonus to Armor Class due to your reduced size.
<br />2. If you spend 2 additional power points, this power's duration is 1 minute per level rather than 1 round per level.</div>
