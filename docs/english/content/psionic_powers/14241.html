<br />
<br />Your body and all your equipment are subsumed by your shadow. As a living shadow, you drift in and out of the shadow plane, giving you total concealment (50% miss chance).
<br />
<br />While in your shadow body, you gain damage reduction 10/+1 and darkvision. You are immune to extra damage from critical hits, ability damage, disease, drowning, and poison. You take only half damage from acid, electricity, and fire of all kinds.
<br />
<br />While affected by this power, you can be detected by powers that read thoughts, life, or presences (including true seeing).
<br />
<br />If you take any hostile actions, you will return fully to the Prime Material plane for a round.</div>
