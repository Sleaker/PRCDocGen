Setup:

<ol>
<li>Download the file and extract the contents in a convenient location</li>
<li>If you have not already done so, install the java runtime executables (found <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
<li>Check to see if there is a directory named "portraits" in your NWN directory. If one does not exist, create it.</li>
<li><big style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><b><u>Run the batch file</u></b></big> in the directory to start the character creator. You should end up with a screen similar to this:
<p>

</p></li><li>Select "Settings" and you should end up with a screen similar to this:
<p>
<img src="../../../images/46%20javacc%20settings.jpg">

</p></li><li>
<ul>
<li>Select the correct installation folder for NWN - on windows it will probably find this for you from the registry.</li>
<li>Select the haks as shown. The + key will give you a standard file
browser with multi select (ctrl or shift + click) capability. Order
isn't important.</li>
<li>Select the prc_consortium custom TLK.</li>
<li>Don't change the default TLK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click OK and you should be ready to create your first character.</li>
</ol>

Using the java character creator:

<ol>
<li><big style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><b><u>Run the batch file</u></b></big> in the directory to start the character creator. You should end up with a screen similar to this:
<p>
<img src="../../../images/45%20javacc%20start.jpg">

</p></li><li>Select "Create Character" to create a level 1 character
for use in modules with the PRC installed. You should end up with a
screen similar to this:
<p>
<img src="../../../images/47%20javacc%20main.jpg">

</p></li><li>Go through the different stages like you would when using
the character creator within NWN, though there is a difference at the
portrait stage:
<p>
<img src="../../../images/48%20javacc%20portrait.jpg">
</p><p>Here there are two checkboxes on the left of the screen. These
restrict which portraits are displayed, based on gender or race. If you
are using a new PRC race, you will have to deselect "Lock to Race" in
order to see any portraits.
</p></li><li>When you get to the appearance stage, and want to know
what all the options look like, open the toolset and edit a creature to
look like what you want, then note the numbers:

</p></li><li>Once you have reached the end of the process, press "Finalize" to create the character.</li>
</ol>

You can select your characterin-game by pressing "Use a pre-made character" and selecting it from the list that appears.
