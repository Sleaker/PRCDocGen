<br>
<br>The PRC can work with CEP, but there are some minor issues. All of
these can be resolved by using a merge hak and tlk file.
The merge hak sits above both PRC and CEP in the module custom content
list and contains the 2da files that both CEP and PRC change.
The merge tlk is used instead of either individual tlk file.
<br>
<br>To make a set of merged files, start by creating a new clean module in the toolset.
<br>Then add all the CEP content as per the CEP instructions.
<br>Save the module and exit the toolset. Then run the PRC Module Updater on the module.
<br>This will complain about some conflicts, but should sort most of them out.
<br>It should produce a new hak and tlk file naed after the module in your hak and tlk
directories. To make it easier for future reference, I would rename those files into something
recognisable, such as CEPxxxPRCxxx. You can also delete the module as it is no longer needed.
<br>
<br>At this point, the merge files created will work on a basic level, but will have a few bugs. The main files
that has problems is baseitems.2da so I suggest you extract that from the merge hak and from prc_2das.hak making
sure that they go to different directories so they dont overwrite each other. Then use a plain text editor to copy
the lines 0-112 from the prc version over the same lines in the merge version. After than, put the modified merge
version of the 2da back into the merge hak.
<br>
<br>Now your merge hak should be complete and free from any issues. One more think to remember though, when
changing a PRC-enabled modules custom content from the toolset, press cancel as soon as possible
once the toolset starts recompiling. If you dont, the toolset will crash when it tries to recompile the
PRC scripts.
