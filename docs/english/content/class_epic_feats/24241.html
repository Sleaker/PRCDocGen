			<div class="div_paddedicon"></div>
			<div>An epic favored soul continues to grow closer to her deity, gaining more and more divine characteristics and resistances. A truly high level epic favored soul is easily mistaken for an angel, devil, demon, or similar outsider.
<br />
<br />Hit Die: d8.
<br />
<br />Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.
<br />
<br />Spells: The favored soul's caster level is equal to her class level. The favored soul's number of spells per day does not increase after 20th level. The favored soul does not learn additional spells.
<br />
<br />Improved Energy Resistance (Ex): Starting at 22nd level, and every four levels thereafter, the favored soul adds +10 to one of her three energy resistances.
<br />
<br />Divine Gift (Ex): At 25th level and every five levels thereafter, a favored soul's bond with her deity grows stronger and manifests physically. She can choose any one of the following benefits at this time.
<br />
<br />Damage Reduction (Ex): The favored soul's damage reduction increases by +2.
<br />
<br />Increased Flight: The favored soul's flying speed increases by +10 ft.
<br />
<br />Natural Armor: The favored soul's natural armor bonus increases by +2.
<br />
<br />Sacred Ability: The favored soul gains a +1 bonus to an ability score of her choice. Each time this gift is chosen, the favored soul must select a new ability to modify.
<br />
<br />Sacred Skill: The favored soul gains a +4 sacred bonus on one skill. Each time this gift is chosen, the favored soul must select a new skill to modify.
<br />
<br />Sacred Spell: The favored soul selects one spell she knows; the selected spell's level must be equal to or less than her favored soul level divided by 10. She can cast this spell one time each day without expending a spell slot, and each time she casts this spell it resolves at caster level +2. Each time this gift is chosen, the favored soul must select a new spell to make sacred.
<br />
<br />These benefits carry with them some form of physical change appropriate to the favored soul's deity. This can be something as simple as glowing eyes, or it can be something as impressive as skin made of liquid fire. In all cases, apart from the actual game benefit granted by the divine gift, this change is physical only.
<br />
<br />Bonus Feats: The epic favored soul gains a bonus feat (selected from the list of epic favored soul feats) at 23rd level and again every three levels after that.
<br />
