			<div>An epic warmage has perfected the art of destruction and devastation through his magic. He can lay waste to entire armies and cities with horrifying ease and shocking efficiency.
<br />
<br />Hit Die: d6.
<br />
<br />Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.
<br />
<br />Spells: The warmage's caster level is equal to his class level. The warmage's number of spells per day does not increase after 20th level. The warmage does not learn additional spells, except through the advanced learning class feature (see below).
<br />
<br />Advanced Learning (Ex): An epic warmage continues to add new spells to his spell list once every four levels; the spell added must be a wizard spell of the evocation school. Once a new spell is selected, it is forever added to that warmage's spell list and can be cast like any other spell on the warmage's list.
<br />
<br />Bonus Feats: The epic warmage gains a bonus feat (selected from the list of epic warmage feats) at 23rd level and again every three levels after that.
<br />
<br />Epic Warmage Bonus Feat List: Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Epic Staff, Craft Epic Wondrous Item, Energy Resistance, Epic Spell Focus, Epic Spell Penetration, Epic Spellcasting, Ignore Material Components, Improved Combat Casting, Tenacious Magic.</div>
