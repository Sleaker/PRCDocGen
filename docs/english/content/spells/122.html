<br />Mordenkainen's Disjunction attempts to strip all magical effects from a single target. It can also target a group of creatures, attempting to remove the two most powerful spell effects from each creature. To remove an effect, the caster makes a dispel check of 1d20, +1 per caster level (to a maximum of +40) against a DC of 11 + the spell effect's caster level. In addition to its ability to dispel effects, this spell also strips a single enemy of up to 6 magical defenses or a group of enemies of two spell protections each. Finally, the spell will lower the SR of all creatures within the area of effect by 10.
<br />
<br />Affected spells include: Spell Mantles, Globes of Invulnerability, Stoneskins, Premonition, Protection from Elements, Ghostly and Ethereal Visage, Mage Armor, Shadow Shield and Elemental Shield.</div>
