<br /> Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.
<br />
<br />Mirror image creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a mirror image. When you and the mirror image separate, observers cant use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.
<br />
<br />Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An images AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a fireball).</div>
