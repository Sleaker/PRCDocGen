Each round on your turn, starting when you cast the spell, the blades deal 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) to all creatures in the affected area.
<br />
<br />The blades conjured by a lawful-aligned cleric are cold iron, those conjured by a chaotic-aligned cleric are silver, and those conjured by a cleric who is neither lawful nor chaotic are steel.
