			<div>Last Judgment
<br />Necromancy [Death, Good]
<br />Level: Clr 8, Sor/Wiz 8, Wrath 8
<br />Components: V, Celestial (caster must be good outsider)
<br />Casting Time: 1 round
<br />Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
<br />Target: One evil humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or
<br />giant/2 levels
<br />Duration: Instantaneous
<br />Saving Throw: Will partial
<br />Spell Resistance: Yes
<br />
<br />Reciting a list of the targets' evil deeds, you call down the judgment of the heavens upon their heads. Creatures that fail their saving throw are struck
<br />dead and bodily transported to the appropriate Lower Planes to suffer their eternal punishment. Creatures that succeed nevertheless take 3d6 points of temporary Wisdom damage as guilt for their misdeeds overwhelms their minds.
<br />
<br />This spell affects only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, and giants of evil alignment.
<br />
<br />A true resurrection or miracle spell can restore life to a creature slain by this spell normally. A resurrection spell works only if the creature's body can be recovered from the Lower Planes before the resurrection is cast.</div>
