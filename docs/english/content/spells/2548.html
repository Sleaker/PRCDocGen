			<div>Eye of the Beholder
<br />Transmutation [Evil]
<br />Level: Sor/Wiz 7
<br />Components: V S
<br />Casting Time: 1 action
<br />Range: Personal
<br />Target: Caster
<br />Duration: 1 round/level
<br />
<br />One of the caster's eyes grows out of her head on an eyestalk, becoming like that of a beholder. Due to the mobility of the eye, the caster gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Spot checks. More important, the eye has one of the beholder's eye powers,
<br />determined randomly. The caster can use this power as a standard action during the spell's duration.
<br />
<br />Each type of eye produces an effect identical to that of a spell cast by a 13th level caster, but it follows the rules for a ray (see Aiming a Spell in Chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook). All of these effects have a range of 150 feet and a save
<br />DC of 18.
<br />
<br />Roll 1d10 to see which eye the caster gains.
