			<div>Spores of the Vrock
<br />Conjuration (Creation) [Evil]
<br />Level: Clr 2, Demonologist 1
<br />Components: V S, M/DF
<br />Casting Time: 1 full round
<br />Area: 5-ft. radius, centered on caster
<br />Duration: Instantaneous
<br />Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
<br />Spell Resistance: Yes
<br />
<br />The caster summons a mass of spores that fill the
<br />area around him.
<br />
<br />The spores deal 1d8 points of damage to all creatures within 5 feet other than the caster. Then they penetrate the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d2 points of damage each round for 10 rounds. At the end of this time, a tangle of viney
<br />growths covers each subject. A delay poison spell stops the spores' growth for its duration. Bless, neutralize poison, or remove disease kills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial of holy water.
<br />
<br />Arcane Material Component: The feathers of an
<br />avian creature with an intelligence score of at
<br />least 3 (a harpy, achaierai, or similar creature).
