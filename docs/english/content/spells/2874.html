<br />Level: Sor/Wiz 5, Travel 5
<br />Components: V
<br />Casting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Range: Personal and touch
<br />Target: You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures
<br />Duration: Instantaneous
<br />Saving Throw: None
<br />Spell Resistance: No
<br />
<br />This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. *
<br />
<br />You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. **
<br />
<br />To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.
<br />
<br />On Target:
<br />  You appear where you want to be.
<br />Off Target:
<br />  You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.
<br />Far Off Target:
<br />  You wind up somewhere completely different.
<br />Mishap:
<br />  You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten scrambled. You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time Mishap comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

<br />Notes:
<br /> *  Implemented as within 10ft of you due to the lovely quality of NWN location tracking code.
<br /> ** Implemented as you having to have marked the location beforehand using the "Mark Location"
