			<div>The epic artificer remains a master of item creation, gaining
<br />an increasing craft reserve and plenty of bonus feats to
<br />learn the craft of epic item creation.
<br />
<br />Knowledge is power and the quest for knowledge never ends. There is an ever lasting supply of arcane lore for you, the epic wizard,  to discover.
<br />
<br />Hit Die: d6
<br />Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4+ Int Modifier
<br />Bonus Feats:  The epic artificer gains a bonus epic item creation feat every three levels after 20th
<br />
<br />Infusions: An epic artificer's caster level is equal to his class level. The artificer's number of infusions per day does not increase after 20th level.
<br />An epic artificer doesn't automatically gain infusion slots above 6th level, though he can select the Improved Spell Capacity feat to gain infusion slots above 6th level (which can be used to hold lower-level infusions or infusions whose level has been increased above 6th by the use of metamagic feats).
<br />Craft Reserve: An epic artificer's craft reserve increases by 1,000 points per level beyond 20th (6,000 points at 21st level. 7,000 points at 22nd level, and so on).</div>
