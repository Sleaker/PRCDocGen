<br />Prerequisite: Alienist 10
<br />
<br />At 10th level, the alienist, through long association with alien entities and intense study of insane secrets, transcends her mortal form and becomes an alien creature. Her type changes to "outsider," which means (among other things) that she is no longer affected by spells the specifically target humanoids, such as charm person, but she can be hedged out by a magic circle spell against her alignment. Additionally, the alienist gains damage reduction 20/+1 and electricity resistance 20. 
<br />
<br />Upon achieving transcendence, the alienist's appearance undergoes a minor physical change, usually growing a tentacle or other strange addition or subtraction, such as an extra appendage, organ, eye, or enigmatic lump. The alienist can hide this abnormality in a robe or hood, but the alien growth is not under the alienist's control and sometimes moves, twitches, opens, or otherwise animates of its own accord. 
<br />
<br />Anyone who shares the alienist's predilection for study of the Far Realms immediately recognizes her transcendent nature, and she gains a +2 circumstance modifier on all Charisma-based skill and ability checks when interacting with such beings. She gains a +2 circumstance modifier on Intimidation checks against all other creatures to whom she reveals her abnormal nature. 
<br />
<br />Implementation notes: if character is not wearing anything in head inventory slot, she gains bonus +2 to all charisma based skills.</div>
