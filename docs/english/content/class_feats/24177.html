<br />Prerequisite: Morninglord of Lathander level 8.
<br />Specifics: Dawn is a powerful symbol of birth and renewal.  Once per day, the morninglord of at least 8th level may spend one interrupted hour before dawn praying to Lathander.  As soon as the sun rises after the prayer ritual, she gains the benefit of a Neutralize Poison, Cure Disease, and Restoration for herself and her entire party.  All party members are also healed 1d6 + morninglord level in hitpoints.
<br />Use: Selected.  The character must not move or cast spells during the prayer, which must occur one hour before dawn.</div>
