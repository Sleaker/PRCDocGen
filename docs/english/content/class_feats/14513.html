			<div>Unliving Weapon
<br />Necromancy [Evil]
<br />Level: Clr 3
<br />Components: V, S, M
<br />Casting Time: 1 full round
<br />Range: Touch
<br />Targets: One undead creature
<br />Duration: 1 hour/level
<br />Saving Throw: Will negates
<br />Spell Resistance: Yes
<br />
<br />This spell causes an undead creature to explode in a burst of powerful energy when struck for at least 1 point of damage, or at a set time no longer than the duration of the spell, whichever comes first. The explosion is a 10-foot radius burst that deals 1d6 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d6).
<br />
<br />While this spell can be an effective form of attack against an undead creature, necromancers often use unliving weapon to create undead capable of suicide attacks (if such a term can be applied to something that is already dead). Skeletons or zombies with this spell cast upon them can be very dangerous to foes that would normally disregard them.
<br />
<br />Material Component: A drop of bile and a bit of sulfur.
