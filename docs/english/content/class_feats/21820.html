			<div>Psychokinesis [see text]
<br />Level: Psion/wilder 3
<br />Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Range: Personal and close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); see text
<br />Targets: You and creature or object attacking you; see text
<br />Duration: 1 min./level
<br />Saving Throw: Reflex half or Fortitude half; see text
<br />Power Resistance: Yes
<br />Power Points: 5
<br />Metapsionics: Chain, Empower, Extend, Maximize
<br />
<br />Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You weave a field of potential energy of the chosen type around your body. The first successful attack made against you in each round during the power's duration prompts a response from the field without any effort on your part. The attack may be physical, the effect of a power, or the effect of a spell (including spell-like, supernatural, and extraordinary abilities). An 'ectoburst' discharges from the field, targeting the source of the attack and dealing 4d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. To be affected, a target must be within close range. The ectoburst is a ranged touch attack.
<br />
<br />Cold: A field of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold retort is a Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.
<br />Electricity: Manifesting a field of this energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.
<br />Fire: A field of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.
<br />Sonic: A field of this energy type deals -1 point of damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.
<br />
<br />This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.
<br />
<br />Augment: For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration increases by 1 minute.</div>
