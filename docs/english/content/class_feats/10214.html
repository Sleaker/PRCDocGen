			<div>Evocation [Force] 
<br />Level: Sor/Wiz 1
<br />Components: V, S, M
<br />Casting Time: 1 action
<br />Range: Close (25' + 5'/2 levels)
<br />Effect: 3 foot diameter disk of force
<br />Duration: 1 hour per caster level
<br />Saving Throw: None
<br />Spell Resistance: No
<br />
<br />The caster creates a slightly concave circular plane of force that will follow him carrying what is placed upon it. The disk can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level (if used to transport a liquid, the capacity is 2 gallons). The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground and 5 feet behind the caster at all times and remains level. Some adjustment can occur due to stairs or other consideration (concentration necessary for caster to direct disk), but the disk will remain level and cannot change in size, so that tight steep shaft might not be accessibly by the disk.
<br />
<br />The disk will wink out of existence when the spell duration expires, returning all items to casters inventory. The disk moves at 30 feet per round, and the spell also ends if the caster moves away from the disk further than the maximum range of the spell. The caster needs to assure a stable path for the spell, as the disk will wink out if the floor suddenly drops away beneath it.
<br />
<br />Material Component: A drop of mercury.</div>
