<br />The subject of the power hops forward in time 1 round for every manifester level you have. In effect, the subject seems to disappear in a shimmer of silver energy, then reappear after the duration of this power expires. The subject reappears in exactly the same orientation and condition as before. From the subject's point of view, no time has passed at all.
<br />
<br />In each round of the power's duration, it can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom check. Success allows the subject to return. The subject can act normally on its next turn after this power ends.
<br />
<br />Augment: You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.
<br />1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can affect a creature of one size category larger.
<br />2. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect an additional target. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.</div>
