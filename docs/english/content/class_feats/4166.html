			<div>You lack a physical body. Such creatures are insubstantial and can't be touched by nonmagical matter or energy. Likewise, they cannot manipulate objects or exert physical force on objects. However, incorporeal beings have a tangible presence that sometimes seems like a physical attack against a corporeal creature.
<br />
<br />Incorporeal creatures are present on the same plane as the characters, and characters have some chance to affect them.
<br />
<br />Incorporeal creatures can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, by magic weapons, or by spells, spell-like effects, or supernatural effects. They are immune to all nonmagical attack forms.
<br />
<br />Even when struck by magic or magic weapons, an incorporeal creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source.
<br />
<br />Incorporeal creatures are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks.</div>
