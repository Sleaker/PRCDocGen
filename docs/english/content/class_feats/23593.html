			<div>Type of Feat: Class Specific
<br />Prerequisite: Beguiler 2.
<br />
<br />Specifics: Starting at 2nd level, when you successfully use the Bluff skill to feint in combat, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus (if it has one) to AC for the next melee attack you make against it or the next spell you cast. You must remain in melee with the target, and the attack must be made or the spell cast on or before your next turn. The target is not considered flat-footed and therefore can make attacks of opportunity against you if you do not cast defensively.
<br />
<br />At 6th level, you gain the ability to feint in combat as a move action instead of a standard action. If you have the Improved Feint feat, you can feint in combat as a swift action.
<br />
<br />(NOT IMPLEMENTED!!!)
