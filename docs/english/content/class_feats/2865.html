			<div>Type of Feat: Class Specific
<br />Prerequisites: Crusader 1.
<br />Specifics: You have a delayed damage pool that allows you to forestall the effects of many injuries. When you are attacked, any damage is added to your delayed damage pool. At the end of the next round, you take damage equal to the total stored in the delayed damage pool. Any damage beyond the maximum delayed comes off of your normal hit points. This does not negate any special attack such as poison.
<br />
<br />At 1st level, your delayed damage pool can hold 5 points of damage. The maximum your pool can hold increases by 5 at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 20th level to a maximum of 30.
