<br />Prerequisites: Soulknife 6th
<br />Specifics: At 6th level, a soulknife gains the ability to enhance his mind blade. He can add a weapon special ability that has an enhancement bonus value of +1.
<br /> At every four levels beyond 6th, the value of the enhancement a soulknife can add to his weapon improves by +1, A soulknife can choose any combination of weapon special abilities that does not exceed the total allowed by the soulknife's level. For example, an 18th-level soulknife could add two +2 weapon special abilities, or one +1 weapon ability and one +3 weapon ability.
<br /> The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the soulknife materializes his mind blade (unless he decided to reassign it's abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes, including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities.
<br /> A soulknife can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade. To do so, he must first spend 8 hours in concentration. After that period, the mind blade materializes with the new ability or abilities selected by the soulknife.
<br />Use: Automatic on manifesting mindblades, select to change special abilities
