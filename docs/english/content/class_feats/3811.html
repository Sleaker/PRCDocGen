			<div>Type of Feat: Class
<br />Requirements: Champion of Corellon level 1
<br />You gain the ability to heal wounds by touch, much like a Paladin's Lay on Hands ability. Each day you can heal a total number of hitpoints of damage equal to your Champion level x your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). For example, a 6th level Champion of corellon with a Charisma score of 14 can heal 12 points of damage per day. You can choose to divide the healing among multiple recipients and you don't have to do it all at once. Using this ability is a standard action.
<br />You can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using Corellon's blessing in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. You decide how much of your daily allotment of healing to use as damage after successfully touching your undead foe.
<br />If you have levels in Paladin, you add your levels of Champion of Corellon and Paladin together and determine your ability to heal accordingly (although if you have a Charisma score lower than 12, your Paladin levels do not contribute to your ability to heal).</div>
