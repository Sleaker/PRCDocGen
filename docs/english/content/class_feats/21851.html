			<div>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]
<br />Level: Psion/wilder 4
<br />Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
<br />Target: One creature
<br />Duration: Instantaneous
<br />Saving Throw: None
<br />Power Resistance: No
<br />Power Points: 7, XP; see text
<br />Metapsionics: None
<br />
<br />When this power is manifested, the subject can choose to make again all the decisions related to the latest level it has gained.
<br />
<br />The subject can undo decisions of these sorts that were made at lower levels, if both the subject and the manifester agree to pay the necessary XP before this power is manifested (see below).
<br />
<br />XP Cost: This power costs 50 XP to manifest to reformat choices made when the character reached her current level. For each additional previous level into which the revision reaches, the power costs an additional 50 XP. The manifester and subject split all XP costs evenly.
<br />
<br />Augmentation: For every additional power point you spend, the revision reaches one level further. The XP cost is accordingly increased, as specified above.
<br />
<br />
<br />Implementation Note: This power may optionally be nerfed via a switch, changing it's behaviour to only allow reselection of psionic powers gained in the reformed levels.</div>
