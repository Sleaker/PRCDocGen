<br />The subject contracts a particularly terrible and contagious disease, which strikes immediately with no incubation period. The caster infects the subject with a sickness that deals 1d4 points of Constitution drain each day until the subject dies. The subject may attempt a new saving throw each day, but she must succeed at two saves in a row to rid herself of the disease (as with most diseases).
<br />However, the disease, once unleashed, continues to spread. For the first day of the sickness, anyone touching the subject must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or fall victim to the same malady. That victim in turn becomes contagious on the first day of her own affliction.
<br />
