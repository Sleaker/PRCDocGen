			<div>Necropolitan is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to here after as the base creature).
<br />A necropolitan speaks any languages it knew in life, and it has all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
<br />
<br />Size and Type
<br />The creature's type changes to undead, and it gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.
<br />
<br />Hit Dice: Increase to d12.
<br />
<br />Special Qualities
<br />A necropolitan retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains those described below.
<br />
<br />Resist Control (Ex)
<br />Necropolitans have a +2 profane bonus on their Will saving throws to resist the effect of a control undead spell.
<br />
<br />Turn Resistance (Ex)
<br />A necropolitan has +2 turn resistance.
<br />
<br />Unnatural Resilience (Ex)
<br />Necropolitans automatically heal hit point damage and ability damage at the same rate as a living creature. The Heal skill has no effect on necropolitans, however negative energy (such as an inflict spell) heals them.
<br />
<br />Abilities
<br />Same as the base creature, except that as undead creatures, necropolitans have no Constitution score.
<br />
<br />Advancement
<br />By character class.
<br />
<br />Level Adjustment
<br />Same as the base creature. (Becoming a necropolitan involves losing a level so the advantages of the undead type cancel out what would other wise be a larger adjustment.)
