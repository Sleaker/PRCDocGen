			<div>Type of Feat: Class Specific
<br />Prerequisite: Ghost-Faced Killer Level 10
<br />Specifics: If a ghost-faced killer slays a foe with his frightful attack, (either from the damage dealt or because of a failed save against its fear effect), he gets an immediate extra melee attack against another target within reach.
<br />If the new target is flat-footed, this extra attack is also a frightful attack, though it doesn't count against the ghost-faced killer's daily limit of frightful attacks.  This ability otherwise functions exactly as the Cleave feat.</div>
