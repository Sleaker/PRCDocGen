			<div>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]
<br />Level: Psion/wilder 5, psychic warrior 5
<br />Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Range: 30 ft.
<br />Area: 30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you
<br />Duration: 1 round/level
<br />Saving Throw: Will negates; see text
<br />Power Resistance: Yes
<br />Power Points: 9
<br />Metapsionics: Extend
<br />
<br />By manifesting this power, you generate psychic static, interfering with the ability of other psionic characters to manifest their powers or use psi-like abilities (you are not affected by your own catapsi manifestation). All psionic activity within the area requires 4 more power points to manifest than normal, unless a character makes a Will save each time he attempts to manifest a power. If two or more fields of catapsi overlap, the effects are not cumulative.
<br />
<br />The limit on the number of power points a subject can spend on a power remains in effect; thus, a subject may not be able to manifest its highest-level powers. If manifesting a power would cause the manifester to exceed his available power points or his spending limits, the manifestation fails automatically, but no power points are expended.</div>
