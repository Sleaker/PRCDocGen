<br />Epic Shining Blade
<br />
<br />Epic Shining Blades are the leaders of Heironeous's armies when they march against evil. They have attained the long sought after goal of becoming but a blade in Heironeous's hand, and are able to slay any evil that dares to stand against the righteous wrath they inflict. Having long since given up earthly pleasures, an Epic Shining Blade is pure martial might and religious fury.
