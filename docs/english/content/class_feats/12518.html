<br />Level: Sor/Wiz 8
<br />Components: V, S
<br />Casting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
<br />Target: One creature
<br />Duration: See text
<br />Saving Throw: None
<br />Spell Resistance: Yes
<br />
<br />You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, forcing the subject to leave. *
<br />
<br />On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and dimension door, do not help a creature escape a maze spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell.
<br />Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.
<br />
<br />
<br />* Implemented such that NPCs always try escape and PCs are given a choice whether to attempt escape or not.</div>
