			<div>Claws of the Savage
<br />Transmutation [Evil]

<br />The caster grants one creature two long claws that replace its hands, tentacle tips, or whatever else is appropriate. The claws deal damage based on the creature's size.
<br />
<br />                Creature Size      Claw Damage
<br />
<br />                Fine                  1
<br />
<br />                Diminutive            1d2
<br />
<br />                Tiny                  1d3
<br />
<br />                Small                 1d4
<br />
<br />                Medium-size           1d6
<br />
<br />                Large                 1d8
<br />
<br />                Huge                  2d6
<br />
<br />                Gargantuan            2d8
<br />
<br />                Colossal              4d6
<br />
<br />The creature can make attacks with both claws as if it were proficient with them. Just as with a creature that has natural weapons, the subject takes no penalty for making two claw attacks. The subject is treated as armed. Furthermore, these
<br />claws gain a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls.
<br />
<br />If the creature already has claws, those claws gain a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and the claws' damage increases as if the creature
<br />were two size categories larger.
