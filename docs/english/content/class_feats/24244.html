			<div>A rage mage can cast spells while in a rage. When she casts a spell of the abjuration, conjuration, evocation, necromancy, or transmutation school while in a rage, the rage mage uses her character level as her caster level. This ability only works when the rage mage is in a spell rage.
<br />
<br />While in a spell rage, a rage mage becomes reckless and loses her some of her ability to defend herself. She temporarily takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class.
<br />
<br />Unlike with a barbarian's rage, a rage mage can use any type of skill or feat while raging. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's Constitution modifier. A rage mage can end her rage voluntarily. At the end of the rage, the character is fatigued (-2 Strength, -2 Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless the rage mage is 10th level, when this limitation no longer applies). A rage mage can only fly into a rage once per encounter, and only a certain number of times per day (determined by level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a rage mage can only do it during her action, not in response to somebody else's action.</div>
