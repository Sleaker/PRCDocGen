			<!-- The icon, if building with icons. icon.html -->
			<div class="div_paddedicon"></div>
			<div>Type of Feat: Exalted.
<br />Prerequisite: Nimbus of Light, Good Alignment*.
<br />Specifics:  You can heal the wounds and ailments of others' using your own life energy. When you activate this ability, as a free action, you immediately take at least 2 points of temporary Constitution damage. You can take as many points of Constitution damage as you wish**, as long as you remain alive and conscious.
<br /> Once you have activated your stigmata, you can touch your allies to heal them of 1 point of constitution damage per level they possess for every 2 points of Constitution damage you take. In addition, any character you touch who is suffering from a disease is cured of it.***
<br /> You can use this touch on one ally per point of Constitution damage you take.***
<br /> When you use this ability, the wounds on your body bleed in proportion to the Constitution damage you take. The bleeding persists for 1 hour and the Constitution damage cannot be restored by any means until the bleeding has stopped. Once the bleeding has stopped, you can freely activate your stigmata again, whether or not you have recovered your lost constitution, as long as you have enough Constitution to use the ability and survive.
<br />Use: Selected.
<br />
<br />Notes:
<br />*: You can select this feat even when evil or neutral, but it will not give you any benefits, so be smart and don't choose it if you can't use it.
<br />**: Limited to 2, 4, 6 and 8 points due to technical limits.
<br />***: Due to technical limits, one cannot "hold the charge" on the stigmata. To make up for that, diseases will always be cured.</div>
