<br />This power transforms your body into living oak, which grants you several advantages.
<br />
<br />You gain damage reduction 10/ slashing and a +5 bonus to natural armor that overlaps (does not stack with) any natural armor bonus you may already have. You are immune to ability damage, blindness, deafness, disease, drowning, poison and stunning.
<br />
<br />You take only half damage from cold effects of all kinds. However, you gain vulnerability to fire.
<br />
<br />You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but you take a -2 penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an armor check penalty of -4 and an arcane spell failure chance of 25%.
<br />
<br />Augment: For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration increases by 1 minute.</div>
