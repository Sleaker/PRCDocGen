			<div>Type of Feat: Class
<br />  Prerequisite: Spellfire Channeler level 1.
<br />  Specifics: The channeler's capacity for storing spellfire energy levels is multiplied by the listed value. However, spellfire energy levels in excess of the channeler's Constitution score is dangerous, with different effects depending upon the number of levels stored:
<br />  Constitution +1 to Constitution X2:
<br />  The channeler's eyes glow brightly, and any creature, magic item or spell effect that touches the channeler causes 1 spellfire energy level to be discharged as a harmless burst of light. Once per day, the channeler must make a constitution check (DC 10) or take 1d6 points of damage as one of her spellfire energy level backfires.
<br />  Constitution X2+1 to Constitution X3:
<br />  As above, except a touch releases 1d4 spellfire energy levels as light, and the channeler must make the backfire Constitution check every hour.
<br />  Constitution X3+1 to Constitution X4:
<br />  As above, except the channeler feels a burning sensation within her body (treat as if distracted by a nondamaging spell, DC 20 to concentrate), and must make the backfire Constitution check every minute. A touch releases 1d6 spellfire energy levels as a flare spell (DC 10 + number of spellfire energy levels expended) against the channeler and all creatures within 5 feet of her.
<br />  Constitution X4+1 to Constitution X5:
<br />  As above, except the character is in pain (treat as if distracted by a nondamaging spell, DC 25 to concentrate), and must make the backfire Constitution check every round. A touch releases 2d6 energy levels as a flare spell (DC 10 + number of spellfire energy levels expended) against the channeler and all creatures within 5 feet of her. The channeler must make a Will save (DC 25) every round or be forced to expend a maximum-strength blast of energy at a random target within 30 feet in preference to any other action.
<br />  Regardless of the number of spellfire energy levels stored, a channeler can voluntarily expend only a number of spellfire energy levels per round equal to her Constitution score. (Involuntary expenditure, such as that noted above, isn't limited in this way.)
