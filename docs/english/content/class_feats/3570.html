			<div>Type of Feat: Class
<br />Prerequisite: Wilder 5th
<br />Specifics: A wilder's temperamental mind is hard to encompass with the discipline of telepathy. When any telepathy power is manifested on a wilder of 5th level or higher, the manifester of the power must pay 1 power point more than he otherwise would have spent.
<br />The extra cost is not a natural part of that power's cost. It does not augment the power; it is simply a wasted power point. The wilder's volatile mind can force the manifester of the telepathy power to exceed the normal power point limit of 1 point per manifester level. If the extra cost raises the telepathy power's cost to more points than the manifester has remaining in his reserve, the power simply fails, and the manifester exhausts the rest of his power points.
<br />At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the penalty assessed against telepathy powers manifested on a wilder is increased by 1 power point  (2 power points at 9th, 3 power points at 13th, and so on).
<br />As a standard action, a wilder can choose to lower this effect for 1 round. *
<br />Use: Automatic
<br />
<br />Technical:
<br />* Since due to the real-time nature of NWN, this would be pain for the users, the Volatile Mind class feature only affects powers used by hostile manifesters.</div>
