			<div>Sarcophagus of Stone
<br />Conjuration (Creation) [Earth]
<br />Level: Clr 6
<br />Components: V S M DF
<br />Casting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Duration: Instantaneous
<br />Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 lvls)
<br />Target: 1 medium or smaller creature
<br />Spell Resistance: No
<br />Saving Throw: Reflex negates
<br />
<br />This spell creates an airtight stone coffin that forms around the target. The stone is 1 inch thick, has hardness 8, and requires 15 points of damage to break through. Decreasing its size does not change the thickness of the walls; the coffin is always just large enough to hold the subject. This coffin is sealed upon formation and completely impervious to air and gas. A creature trapped within a sarcophagus of stone has 1 hour worth of air, and after that time begins to suffocate. A creature that has no need to breathe (such as a construct, elemental, or undead) needs not fear suffocation, but it remains trapped within the sarcophagus until it breaks free or is freed.
<br />
<br />A creature within the coffin can attack the stone with a natural weapon or light melee weapon. A creature can
<br />attempt a DC 26 Strength check to break free of the stone, and allies can also help to break the trapped creature
<br />free.
