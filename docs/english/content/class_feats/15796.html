<br />This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself. Once Foresight is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm. You would be warned in advance if a Rogue were about to attempt a sneak attack on you, or if a creature were about to leap out from a hiding place, or if an attacker were specifically targeting you with a spell or ranged weapon. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself -- duck, jump right, close your eyes, and so on -- and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.</div>
