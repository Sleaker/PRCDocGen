			<div>Type: Class
<br />Prerequisite: Shugenja level 1
<br />All Shugenjas have a favored element: air, earth, fire, or water. A Shugenja's choice of specialized element is sometimes determined by the Shugenja order in which he studies. At least half the spells the Shugenja knows must belong to his favored element, and the spell dictated by his order often belongs to that element as well. Shugenjas automatically gain the benefits of the Spell Focus feat (+1 to spell DCs) for spells from their favored element, regardless of it's school
<br />As the cost of specializing in one element, a Shugenja is prohibited from learning spells associated with a different element. The prohibited element is dictated by the favored element, as described below.
<br />Air: Air spells are subtle, involving travel, intuition, influence, divination, and illusion. Earth is the prohibited element for Air Shugenjas. The Order of the All-Seeing Eye and the Order of the Spring Zephyr specialize in Air magic.
<br />Earth: Earth spells involve resilience and resolve, health and growth, and the strength of it's body. Air is the prohibited element for Earth Shugenjas. The Order of the Impenetrable Crucible and the Order of the Perfect Sculpture specialize in Earth magic.
<br />Fire: Fire spells are destructive and blatant, though they also deal with intelligence, inspiration, and creativity. Water is the prohibited element for Fire Shugenjas. The Order of the consuming Flame specializes in Fire magic.
<br />Water: Water spells involve transformation, cleansing, healing, and friendship. Fire is the prohibited element for Water Shugenjas. The Order of the Forbidding Wasteland and the Order of the Gentle Rain specialize in water magic.
<br />The Shugenjas of the Order of the Ineffable Mystery can specialize in any of the four elements. The Order of the Ineffable Mystery also trains Shugenjas who specialize in the fifth element, the void.</div>
