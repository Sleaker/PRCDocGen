<br />You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject:
<br />1st Round: Presence or absence of evil.
<br />2nd Round: Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the strength of the strongest evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, the strongest evil auras strength is "overwhelming" (see below), and the strength is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. While you are stunned, you cant act, you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, and attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack you.
<br />3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
<br />
<br />Aura Strength: An auras evil power and strength depend on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level.
<br />
<br />Creature/Object         Evil Power
<br />Evil creature           HD / 5
<br />Undead creature         HD / 2
<br />Evil elemental          HD / 2
<br />Evil outsider           HD
<br />Cleric of an evil deity         Caster Level
<br />
<br />Evil Power              Aura Strength
<br />Lingering               Dim
<br />1 or less               Faint
<br />2 - 4           Moderate
<br />5 - 10          Strong
<br />11+             Overwhelming
<br />If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.
<br />
<br />Remember that animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil; this spell does not detect them.
<br />
<br />Note: Each round, you can turn to detect things in a new area but if you move more than 2 meters the spell ends.</div>
