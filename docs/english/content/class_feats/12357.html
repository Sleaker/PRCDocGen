			<div>Fire Shield
<br />Evocation [Fire or Cold]
<br />Level: Fire 5, Sor/Wiz 4, Sun 4
<br />Components: V, S, M/DF
<br />Casting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Range: Personal
<br />Target: You
<br />Duration: 1 round/level (D)
<br />
<br />This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).
<br />
<br />Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based
<br />attacks). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
<br />
<br />When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The special powers of each version are as follows:
<br />
<br />Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
<br />
<br />Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.</div>
