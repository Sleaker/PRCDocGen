			<div>Type of Feat: Class
<br />Prerequisite: Hexblade level 1
<br />Once per day + the Hexblade's CHA modifier, as a free action, a hexblade can unleash a curse upon a foe. The target must be visible to the Hexblade and within 60 feet. The target of a Hexblade's curse takes a -2 penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill checks and weapon damage rolls for one hour thereafter. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hexblade's class level + Hexblade's CHA mod)negates the effect. At every 4th level beyond 1st, a Hexblade gains the ability to use his curse one additional time per day.
<br />
