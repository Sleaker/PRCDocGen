			<div>Lahm's Finger Darts
<br />Transmutation [Evil]
<br />Level: Corrupt 2
<br />Components: V S, Corrupt
<br />Casting Time: 1 action
<br />Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
<br />Targets: Up to five creatures, no two of which can
<br />be more than 15 ft. apart
<br />Duration: Instantaneous
<br />Saving Throw: None
<br />Spell Resistance: Yes
<br />
<br />The caster's finger becomes a dangerous projectile that flies from her hand and unerringly strikes its target. The dart deals 1d4 points of Dexterity
<br />damage. Creatures without fingers cannot cast this spell.
<br />
<br />The dart strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee or has partial cover or concealment. Inanimate objects (locks, doors, and so forth) cannot be damaged by the spell.
<br />
<br />For every three caster levels beyond 1st, the caster gains an additional dart by losing an additional finger: two at 4th level, three at 7th level, four at 10th level, and the maximum of five darts at 13th level or higher. If the caster shoots multiple darts, she can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single dart can strike only one creature. The caster must designate targets before checking for spell resistance or damage.
<br />
<br />Fingers lost to this spell grow back with the use of a Restoration or Regeneration spell.
<br />
<br />Corruption Cost: 1 point of Strength damage per dart, plus the loss of one finger per dart. A hand with one or no fingers is useless.
<br />
<br />Casters of good alignment cannot cast Corrupt spells.</div>
