<br />This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set the conditions of the ward. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally.
<br />
<br />When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil.  When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled.
<br />
<br />A glyph deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.
<br />
<br />Material Component: You trace the glyph with incense, which must first be sprinkled with powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp.</div>
