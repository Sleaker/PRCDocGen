<br />The bane of all casters and their ilk is held within this single spell. It makes you virtually impenetrable by all spells, thus giving you immunity to magic, for a short period of time. It does not stop the flow of magic, but grants upon you ability to manipulate it to stop all harmful effects directed toward you. This does come at a cost however. You forfeit almost all of your endurance in the form of constitution in exchange for spell immunity while the spell is in effect. IE: Your constitution is dropped to 3.
