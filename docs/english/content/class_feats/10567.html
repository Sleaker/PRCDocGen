			<div>Prismatic Sphere
<br />Abjuration
<br />Level: Protection 9, Sor/Wiz 9, Sun 9
<br />Components: V
<br />Range: 10 ft.
<br />Effect: 10-ft.-radius sphere centered on you
<br />
<br />This spell functions like prismatic wall, except you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering,
<br />multicolored light that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in
<br />all colors of the visible spectrum.  The sphere's blindness effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4x10 minutes.
<br />
<br />You can pass into and out of the prismatic sphere and remain near it without harm. However, when you're
<br />inside it, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells). Other
<br />creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.
<br />
<br />Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since you are at the center of the sphere, so
<br />the lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface you are standing on.
<br />
<br />The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a prismatic wall:
<br />
<br />Red     1st     Deals 20 points of fire damage (Reflex half).
<br />Orange  2nd     Deals 40 points of acid damage (Reflex half).
<br />Yellow  3rd     Deals 80 points of electricity damage (Reflex half).
<br />Green   4th     Poison (Kills; Fortitude partial for 1d6 points of Con damage instead).
<br />Blue    5th     Turned to stone (Fortitude negates).
<br />Indigo  6th     Will save or become insane (as insanity spell).
<br />Violet  7th     Creatures sent to another plane (Will negates). </div>
