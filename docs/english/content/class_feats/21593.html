<br />Level: Psychic warrior 1
<br />Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Range: Personal
<br />Target: You
<br />Duration: 1 round./level
<br />Power Points: 1
<br />Metapsionics: Extend
<br />
<br />This power causes instant growth, doubling your height, length, and width and multiplying your weight by 8. This increase changes your size category to the next larger one. You gain a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum effective Dexterity score of 1), a -1 size penalty on attack rolls, and a -1 size penalty to Armor Class due to your increased size.
<br />
<br />This power doesn't change your speed.
<br />
<br />Multiple effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second manifestation of this power to further expand yourself.
<br />
<br />Augment: You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.
<br />1. If you spend 6 additional power points, this power increases your size by two size categories instead of one. You gain a +4 size bonus to Strength, a -4 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum effective Dexterity score of 1), a -2 size penalty on attack rolls, and a -2 size penalty to Armor Class due to your increased size.
<br />2. If you spend 2 additional power points, this power's duration is 10 minutes per level rather than 1 round per level.</div>
