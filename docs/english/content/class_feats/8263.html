<br />Initiation Action: 1 full-round action

<br />In a flashing blur of steel, you unleash a devastating volley of deadly attacks against your enemy, striking it again and again.
<br />
<br />As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack against an opponent. If that attack hits, resolve your damage as normal. You can then make another attack against that foe with a -4 penalty on your attack roll. If that attack hits, you can make another attack against that opponent with a -8 penalty. You continue to make additional attacks, each one with an additional -4 penalty, until you miss or your opponent is killed. You must direct all of these attacks at a single foe.</div>
