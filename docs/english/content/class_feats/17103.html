<br />
<br />Prismatic wall creates a vertical, opaque wall; a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the colors if it
<br />looks at the wall.
<br />
<br />Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the
<br />wall, the order in which they appear, their  effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass
<br />through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.
<br />
<br />Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each
<br />color present.
