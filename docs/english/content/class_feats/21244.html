<br />You receive one kind of sensory input when a different sense is stimulated. In particular, you can feel light and sound on the skin of your face. Your senses continue to work normally as well, unless they are impaired for some reason.
<br />
<br />By feeling light by absorbing ambient light onto your skin, you have your normal visual abilities, even if your eyes are closed or you are blinded. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all Spot and Search checks.
<br />
<br />By feeling sound by absorbing sound onto your skin, the expanded audio input provides you with a +4 circumstance bonus on Listen checks.
<br />
<br />Psionic or magical displacement effects, invisibility effects, illusions, and other similar effects confuse your synesthete senses just as they would your normal senses.
<br />
<br />You can also use this power to see sound if you are deafened, or hear light if you are blinded, thus removing all penalties associated with either condition.</div>
