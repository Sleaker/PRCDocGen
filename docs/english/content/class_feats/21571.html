<br />You call a weapon "from thin air" into your waiting hand (actually, it is a real weapon hailing from another location in space and time). You don't have to see or know of a weapon to call it-in fact, you can't call a specific weapon; you just specify the kind. If you call a projectile weapon, it comes with 3d6 bolts, arrows, or sling bullets, as appropriate. The weapon is made of ordinary materials as appropriate for its kind.
<br />
<br />Weapons gained by call weaponry are distinctive due to their astral glimmer. They are considered magic weapons and thus are effective against damage reduction that requires a magic weapon to overcome.
<br />
<br />Augment: For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power improves the weapon's enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls by 1.</div>
