			<div>Type of Feat: Class Specific
<br />Prerequisite: CW Samurai Level 20
<br />Specifics: A 20th-level Samurais bravery, honor, and fighting prowess have become legendary. When the samurai draws his blade, opponents within 30 feet must succeed on a Will save(DC 20 + Cha Modifier) or become panicked for 4d6 rounds (if they have 4 or fewer Hit Dice) or shaken for 4d6 rounds (if they have more than 4 Hit Dice, but fewer than the Samurai). Creatures with more Hit Dice then the Samurai are not affected. Any foe that successfully resists the effect cannot be affected again by the same samurai's frightful presence for 24 hours.
<br />
<br />Panicked: A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can't take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack.
<br />
<br />Shaken: A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.</div>
