			<div>Type of Feat: Class Specific
<br />Prerequisite: Ghost-Faced Killer Level 3
<br />Specifics: Once per day a Ghost-Faced Killer can panic onlookers and even frighten his victim to death by making a sudden strike attack.  The ghost-faced killer must use his power attack feat on the attack.
<br />The victim must make a Will save (DC 10 + ghost-faced killer class level + ghost-faced killer Cha modifier) or die.  If the victim succeeds at the save, the victim becomes shaken for 1 round per class level of the ghost-faced killer.
<br />Onlookers within a 30 foot radius (not including the victim, the ghost-faced killer, or allies of the ghost-faced killer) must make a Will save (DC 10 + ghost-faced killer class level + ghost-faced killer's Cha modifier + damage bonus from power attack on the frightful attack).
<br />If the onlooker fails this save, she will become panicked (if her hit dice are less than the ghost-faced killer's class level + the ghost-faced killer's Cha modifier) or shaken.
<br />The Ghost-Faced Killer gains another use per day every 3 levels.</div>
