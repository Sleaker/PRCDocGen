			<div>Type of Feat: Class.
<br />Prerequisite: Level 10 Warpriest.
<br />
<br />Specifics: At 10th level, the Warpriest can channel so much positive energy to allies within a 100-foot radius that they will continue to fight even though suffering mortal wounds. Using this ability is a move-equivalent action and requires concentration. While in use, allies within the radius who take enough damage to become disabled or dying ignore the effects of that damage and continue fighting. Death occurs instantly at -20 hit points. When use of the ability ends, either because the Warpriest stops concentrating, fails a Concentration check, or becomes disabled (or worse), then the full effects of all damage take immediate effect.
