			<div>Type of Feat: Class
<br />Prerequisites: Soulknife 9th
<br />Specifics: At 9th level, a soulknife gains the ability to momentarily fragment his mind blade into numerous identical blades, each of which strikes at a nearby opponent.
<br /> As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, a soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead fragment his mind blade to make one melee attack at his full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. Each fragment functions identically to the soulknife's regular mind blade.
<br /> When using bladewind, a soulknife forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as the Cleave feat or the haste spell).
<br /> The mind blade immediately reverts to it's previous form after the bladewind attack.
<br /> This feat counts as Whirlwind Attack for the purpose of prerequisites.
<br />Use: Selected
<br />
<br />Note: If you have Improved Whirlwind Attack, use this feat to trigger it instead of it's own entry.</div>
