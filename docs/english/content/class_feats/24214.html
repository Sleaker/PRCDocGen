<br />Prerequisite: Alienist 1
<br />
<br />When an alienist casts any summon creature spell, she summons a "pseudonatural" version of a creature. This adds the pseudonatural template to the summoned creature (see Pseudonatural Creatures below). If the selected creature would normally be celestial of fiendish, the pseudonatural template replaces that template.
<br />
<br />Pseudonatural Creatures:
<br />Pseudonatural creatures dwell past the eons that lie between the stars, between the planes as we know them, nestled in far realms of insanity. When summoned to the Material Plane they often take the form of, and emulate the abilities of familiar creatures, though they are more gruesome in appearance than their earthly counterparts. Alternatively, they may appear in a manner more consistent with their origins: A mass of writhing tentacles is a favorite, although other terrible forms are always possible. 
<br />
<br />A pseudonatural creature retains all the special qualities of the base creature and also gains the following.
<br />
<br />True Strike (Su): Once per day, the creature can make a normal attack with a +20 insight modifier on a single attack roll. The creature is not affected by the miss chance that applies to attacks against a concealed target.
<br />
<br /> - Electricity and acid resistance (see the table below).
<br /> - Damage reduction (see the table below). 
<br /> - SR equal to double the creature's HD (maximum 25).
<br />
<br />Hit Dice  Electricity, Acid    Damage
<br />                 Resistance       Reduction 
<br />1-3                  5                      - 
<br />4-7                  10                  5/+1 
<br />8-11                15                  5/+2 
<br />12+                 20                 10/+3 
<br />
<br />If the base creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value. 
<br />
<br />Alternative Form (Su) 
<br />At will, a pseudonatural creature can take the form of a grotesque, tentacled mass, but all its abilities remain unchanged despite the alien appearance. Changing shape is a standard action. Other creatures receive a -1 morale penalty to their attack rolls against pseudonatural creatures in this alternate form. 
<br />
<br />Saves 
<br />Same as the base creature. 
<br />
<br />Abilities 
<br />Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is at least 3. 
<br />
<br />Skills 
<br />Same as the base creature. 
<br />
<br />Feats 
<br />Same as the base creature. </div>
