			<div>Tiger Claw (Boost)
<br />Level: Swordsage 8, warblade 8
<br />Prerequisite: Three Tiger Claw maneuvers
<br />Initiation Action: 1 swift action
<br />Range: Melee attack
<br />Target: One or more creatures
<br />Duration: 1 round
<br />
<br />Windmilling your arms in a furious blur, you strike your perplexed enemy from two directions at once, rending his flesh with each strike.
<br />
<br />You must initiate this maneuver before making any attacks in the current round, and you must have two weapons equipped. If you strike an opponent multiple times during your turn, you also deal rend damage. This damage is based on the number of times you strike your opponent during your turn (see the table below). Determine the rend damage dealt immediately after you make your last attack for your turn.
<br />If you attack multiple opponents during your turn, you gain this extra damage against each of them. A creature takes rend damage based on the number of attacks that hit it, not the number of successful attacks you make. For example, if you hit a fire giant three times and an evil cleric twice during your turn, the fire giant takes rend damage for three attacks and the cleric takes rend damage for two attacks.
