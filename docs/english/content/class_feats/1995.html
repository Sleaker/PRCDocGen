			<div>A Sublime Chord of 2nd level or higher with 12 or more ranks in the Perform skill learns how to use her Bardic Music to assist her spellcasting. As a move action, she can prepare to cast a spell by giving voice to the song of power. The next spell she casts gains a bonus to it's caster level based on the result of the Sublime Chord's Perform Check. The spell to be enhanced by the arcane song of power must be cast by the end of the Sublime Chord's next turn, or else the song fades with no effect (other than consuming a Bardic Music use).
