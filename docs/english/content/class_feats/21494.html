			<div>Psychokinesis
<br />Level: Psion/wilder 4
<br />Manifesting Time: 1 swift action
<br />Range: 20 ft.
<br />Area: 20-ft.-radius spread centered on you
<br />Duration: 1 round
<br />Saving Throw: None
<br />Power Resistance: Yes
<br />Power Points: 7
<br />Metapsionics: Extend, Widen
<br />
<br />You encase yourself and your allies in a shimmering fortress of telekinetic force. All damage from powers and psi-like abilities taken by subjects inside the area of the intellect fortress, including ability damage, is halved. This lowering takes place prior to the effects of other powers or abilities that lessen damage, such as damage reduction and evasion.
<br />
<br />Powers that are not subject to power resistance are not affected by an intellect fortress.
<br />
<br />Manifesting this power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round.
<br />
<br />Augment: For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration increases by 1 round.</div>
