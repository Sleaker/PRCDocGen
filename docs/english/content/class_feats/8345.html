			<div>Shadow Hand (Strike)
<br />Level: Swordsage 6
<br />Initiation Action: 1 standard action
<br />Range: 6 ft.
<br />Target: One flat-footed creature
<br />Duration: 1 round
<br />Saving Throw: Fortitude partial
<br />
<br />As your foe struggles to ready his defenses, you make a subtle gesture in the air. A noose formed of shadow drops from above him, wraps around his throat, and hoists him aloft. His limbs flail as he struggles to free himself from the strangling noose.
<br />
<br />As part of this maneuver, you form a noose of shadow that wraps around your target and strangles him. This maneuver only works against a flat-footed target. As part of this maneuver, you make a ranged touch attack against a flat-footed creature within range. If it hits, your opponent takes 8d6 points of damage. In addition, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 16 + your Wis modifier) or be stunned for 1 round. A successful save negates the stun, but not the extra damage. This strike has no effect against non-living creatures, such as constructs and the undead.
<br />This maneuver is a supernatural ability.</div>
