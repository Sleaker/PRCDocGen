<br />  Prerequisite: Serene Guardian level 1
<br />  Specifics: Whenever you deal damage to a foe two or more times in a single round, you create 1 point of resonance in that enemy. At 5th level, if you deal damage to a foe three times or more in a single round, you create 2 points of resonance in that opponent.  As a swift action, you can release resonance in the form of searing pain that flows throughout your target's body. For each point of resonance released, that foe takes a - 1 penalty on arrack rolls and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the number of resonance points released. This does not effect those immune to critical hits or sneak attacks.
