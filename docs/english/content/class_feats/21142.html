<br />You fashion an ephemeral mass of pseudo-living ectoplasm called an ectoplasmic shambler. As the consistency of the ectoplasmic shambler is that of thick mist, those within the shambler are blinded. In addition, manifesting powers (or casting spells) within the shambler is difficult due to the constant turbulence felt by those caught in the shambler's form.
<br />
<br />Creatures enveloped by the shambler, regardless of Armor Class, take 1 point of damage for every two manifester levels you have in each round they become or remain within the roiling turbulence of the shambler. Anyone trying to manifest a power must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + power's or spell's level) to successfully manifest a power or cast a spell inside the shambler.</div>
