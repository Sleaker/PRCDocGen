			<div>Phoenix Fire
<br />Necromancy [Fire, Good]
<br />Level: Sanctified 7
<br />Components: V,S,F,Sacrifice
<br />Range: 15 feet
<br />Area: 15 foot radius spread, centered on you
<br />Duration: Instantaneous (see text)
<br />Saving Throw: Reflex half (see text)
<br />Spell Resistance: Yes (see text)
<br />
<br />You immolate yourself, consuming your flesh in a cloud of flame 20 feet high and 30 feet in diameter. You die (no saving throw, and spell resistance does not apply). Every evil creature within the cloud takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 40d6). Neutral characters take half damage (and a successful Reflex save reduces that further in half), while good characters take no damage at all. Half of the damage dealt by the spell against any creature is fire; the rest results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by protection from energy(fire), fire shield(chill shield), and similar magic.
<br />
<br />After 10 minutes, you rise from the ashes as if restored to life by a resurrection spell.
<br />
<br />Sacrifice: Your death and the level you lose when you return to life are the sacrifice cost for this spell.
<br />
<br />Casters of evil alignment cannot cast Sanctified spells.</div>
