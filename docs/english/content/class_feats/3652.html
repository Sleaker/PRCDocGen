			<div>Feat Type: Class Feat
<br />Prerequisites: Shadowblade 2
<br />Description: Beginning at 2nd level, if you can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from your attack, you can strike a vital spot for extra damage.  Whenever your target is denied a dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage with your attack.  This extra damage increases by 1d6 for every two levels thereafter.  You can't use sudden strike when flanking an opponent unless that opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.  Ranged attacks can count as sudden strike attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.
<br />
<br />Sudden strike functions identically to sneak attack in all other respects.  The extra damage from sudden strike stacks with the extra damage from sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target.  It also stacks with the ephemeral weapon ability of the unseen weapon class feature.</div>
