			<div>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]
<br />Level: Telepath 9
<br />Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
<br />Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
<br />Target: One creature
<br />Duration: Instantaneous
<br />Saving Throw: None
<br />Power Resistance: No
<br />Power Points: 17, XP; see text
<br />Metapsionics: None
<br />
<br />You can repair psychic damage or grant another creature knowledge of powers you know, depending on the version of this power you manifest.
<br />
<br />Repair Psychic Damage: You can remove any compulsions and charms affecting the subject.
<br />
<br />You can remove all negative levels affecting the subject.
<br />
<br />You can also remove all effects penalizing the subject's ability scores, heal all ability damage, and remove any ability drain affecting the subject. Psychic chirurgery negates all forms of insanity, confusion, the effect of such powers as microcosm, and so on.
<br />
<br />Transfer Knowledge: If desired, you can use this power to directly transfer knowledge of a power you know to another psionic character. You can give a character knowledge of a power of any level that she can manifest, even if the power is not normally on the character's power list. Knowledge of powers gained through psychic chirurgery does not count toward the maximum number of powers a character can know per level.
<br />
<br />XP Cost: Each time you use psychic chirurgery to implant knowledge of a power in another creature, you pay an XP cost equal to 1,000 x the level of the power implanted. If you and the subject are both willing to do so, you can split this cost evenly.</div>
