<br />This power transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities.
<br />
<br />You gain damage reduction 15/+5. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, and stunning. You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds.
<br />
<br />You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a '6 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 50%, just as if you were clad in full plate armor.</div>
