			<div>(PRESTIGE CLASS)
<br />Elemental Savants study the basic building blocks of existence - air, earth, fire, water - learning to harness their powers. Eventually they transcend their mortal form and become elemental beings. Most Elemental Savants start out as wizards, although clerics and druids are not unknown. Sorcerers occasionally take this prestige class, but since metamagic feats are of less utility to them, they have difficulty using the class's strengths to the fullest.
