<br />Prerequisite: Healer level 8
<br />When a Healer attains 8th level, the deities recognize her devotion and grant her a Celestial Unicorn Companion as her aide. The Unicorn, a symbol of healing and purity, serves the Healer willingly and unswervingly.
<br />Once per day, the Healer may magically call her companion from the celestial realms in which it resides. The companion immediately appears adjacent to the Healer and remains for 2 hours per Healer level. It may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The companion is the same creature each time it is called, though the Healer may release a particular companion from service to gain a companion of a different kind. Each time the companion is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously.
<br />A Healer of 12th level or higher may select a Lammasu as her companion. Should she do so, the creature gains abilities, as if the character's Healer level was 4 levels lower than it actually is.
<br />A Healer of 16th level or higher may select an Androsphinx as her companion. Should she do so, the creature gains abilities, as if the character's Healer level was 8 levels lower than it actually is.</div>
