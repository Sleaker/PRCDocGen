			<div>Type of Feat: Breath Effect
<br />Prerequisite: Dragonfire Adept level 15
<br />
<br />As a full round action, you breathe 5 different breaths: a cone of acid, a cone of cold, a cone of fire, a line of acid, and a line of electricity.  Each one has its own reflex save, and each one does your full normal damage.
<br />When you use this breath, you take damage equal to twice your class level, which can't be lessened or reduced.  Those who are neutral take four times their adept class level.  In addition, you cannot use any breaths the following round.
<br />This effect can only be learned by non-good adepts.
<br />Use: Selected</div>
