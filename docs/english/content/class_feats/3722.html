			<div>Type: Class
<br />Prerequisite: Scout level 1
<br />A Scout relies on mobility to deal extra damage and improve her defense. She deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The extra damage applies only to attacks taken during the Scout's turn. This extra damage increases by 1d6 for every four levels gained above 1st.
<br />The extra damage only applies to living creatures that have a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage. The Scout must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Scouts can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet.
<br />At 3rd level, a Scout gains a +1 competence bonus to AC during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as the Scout has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves by 1 for every four levels gained above 3rd.
<br />A Scout loses this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.</div>
