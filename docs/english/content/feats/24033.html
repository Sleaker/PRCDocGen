			<div>Type of Feat: Vile
<br />You learn a smattering of the language of truly dark power.
<br />Prerequisites: Will save bonus +5, Int 15, Cha 15.
<br />Benefit: You can use the Dark Speech to bring loathing and fear to others, to help cast evil spells and create evil magic items, and to weaken physical objects.
<br />
<br />Dread: Whenever you use Dark Speech in this manner, you take 1d4 points of Charisma damage, and every other creature in a 30-foot radius must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). The result of a failed save by a listener depends on the listener's character level and alignment, as detailed in the table below.
<br />Level      (Alignment)     Result
<br />1st-4th    (non-evil)      Listener is shaken for 10 rounds and must flee from you until you are out of sight.
<br />1st-4th    (evil)          Listener cowers in fear for 10 rounds.
<br />5th-10th   (non-evil)      Listener is shaken for 10 rounds.
<br />5th-10th   (evil)          Listener is charmed by you (as charm monster) for 10 rounds.
<br />11th+      (non-evil)      Listener is filled with loathing for you but is not otherwise influenced.
<br />11th+      (evil)          Listener is impressed, and you gain a +2 competence bonus on attempts to change its attitude in the future.
<br />
<br />Power: Whenever you use Dark Speech in this manner, you take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. By incorporating the Dark Speech into the verbal component of a spell, you increase its effective caster level by 1.
<br />
<br />Special: You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws made when someone uses the Dark Speech against you.
<br />
<br />Special: If you cannot take ability damage, you cannot select this feat.</div>
