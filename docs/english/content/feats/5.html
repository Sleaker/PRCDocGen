			<div>Type of Feat: General
<br />Prerequisite: Base attack bonus of +1 or higher.
<br />Specifics: Grants the ability to make a potentially disabling attack against an opponent's arms or legs. Called shots are made at a -4 penalty, and must overcome the target's Discipline skill check. A successful called shot against the legs reduces the opponent's movement rate by 20% and gives them a -2 to their dexterity. A successful called shot against the arms applies a cumulative -2 penalty to the creature's attack rolls.
