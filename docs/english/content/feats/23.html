			<div>Type of Feat: General
<br />Prerequisite: None.
<br />Required for: Improved Knockdown.
<br />Specifics: A character with this feat can attempt to knock his melee opponents to the ground. The character makes an attack roll at -4, and if successful the defender makes an opposed Discipline check against the character's attack roll. If the character wins, the defender is knocked to a prone position.
<br />Use: Selected. Prone characters cannot attack. Characters receive a +4 bonus to attack prone opponents in melee, but a -4 penalty to attack them with a ranged weapon. A character can only make a Knockdown attempt on opponents that are one size category larger than himself, or smaller. The opponent gets a +4 bonus on his opposed check for every size category he is larger than the attacker, or a -4 penalty for every size category he is smaller. Monks receives this feat for free at level 6.</div>
