			<div>Type of Feat: General
<br />  Prerequisite: Can only take this feat at 1st-level.
<br />  Specifics: You can use spellfire to absorb spell energy, fire destructive blasts, or heal others.
<br />  A spellfire wielder can ready an action to absorb spells targeted at her as if she were a rod of absorption. She gains one level of spellfire energy for every spell level absorbed and can store a number of spellfire energy levels equal to her Constitution. If she has reached her limit, she cannot absorb spells until she expends some of her stored spellfire levels. If her Constitution decreases so that her number of stored spellfire levels is greater than her current Constitution, the excess levels discharge at a random creature in range as destructive spellfire.
<br />  As a standard action, a spellfire wielder may expend stored spellfire energy as a melee or ranged touch attack (maximum range 400 feet), dealing 1d6 points of spellfire damage per level expended (Reflex half, DC 20). Spellfire damage is half fire damage and half raw magical power. Creatures with immunity, resistance, or protection against fire effects apply these to only half the damage, but not the other half. A creature can also choose "spellfire" as a weapon for the purpose of the Weapon Focus feat.
<br />  A spellfire wielder can heal a target by touch, restoring 2 hitpoints per spellfire energy level expended for this purpose. This is not considered positive energy, so it does not injure undead.
<br />  Use: Selected.</div>
