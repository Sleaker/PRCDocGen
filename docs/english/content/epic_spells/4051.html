<br />Conversing with ones patron deity is never an insignificant task, particularly when the attention of said god is demanded, rather than requested. Pious Parley guarantees council with your patron deity, if you have one, and the deity is available for conversation. The mood of your patron deity, however, is not guaranteed, as your casting essentially interrupts the deity from whatever it was doing, and imparts you with the deities undivided attention. Use this attention wisely.E</div>
