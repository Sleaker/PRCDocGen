<br />Contingent Reunion teleports you to any target when certain conditions arise. Once cast, the spell remains quiescent until triggered, at which point you will instantaneously teleport directly to the location of your target, wherever it may be. You may decide on a variety of trigger conditions, varying from you or your targets death, poisoning, incapacitation, wounded level, etc. Your choices of targets include nearly anything: A spot on the ground, a fellow adventurer, a door, a rock, a tree, etc. While the spell remains quiescent, you lose access to one epic spell slot per day. Once the spell triggers, you regain the reserved spell slot. In addition, you may willfully dispel the contingency to regain the spell slot, at any time before the contingency triggers.</div>
