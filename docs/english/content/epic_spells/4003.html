<br />The call of chaos affects the morals and sense of justice and order in all lawful creatures in the area, causing them to lose their vigilance for a brief time. Each affected creature will act erratic for a time, and will either drop their hand-held equipment and run away, or simply wander about in a state of confusion, suddenly unsure of their own standards of behavior.
<br />A word of caution to the caster of a lawful influence: You may begin to notice a lessening of your so-called diligent tendencies with each casting of this spell.
