<br />Tolodine's killing wind was designed to kill large numbers of creatures, and it worked well; wiping out whole tribes in a single cast. The original spell by Tolodine himself, covered many miles and lasted many hours. The rumor that Tolodine was headed toward your city put a sheer chill up your spine. It was said he walked solo to the battle field, and left solo. Fortunately, the epic vastness of its reaches was lost many ages ago, but the form we have now is still a vast power to be reckoned. Creatures caught within the cloud were entitled a saving throw vs. fortitude at a penalty of -4 or be killed by the spell. Those who remain within the cloud will need to make another save each successive round until they exit the cloud. The casting of this spell automatically temporarily drains the caster of two levels (bestowing negative levels upon him), and two constitution points until the spell evaporates.
