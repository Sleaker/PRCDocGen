<br />To wander unseen, unnoticed that is the desire of all who dislike unwanted attention. With a casting of this spell, the subject gains the permanent ability to willfully turn either invisible or visible on a whim*. This ability can be used as often as wanted, and never requires anything more than a thought to activate the invisibility (or deactivate it).
<br />
<br />*When a subject has Unseen Wanderer cast on him/her, they can access their new ability from their radial menu. The ability is called Wander Unseen.</div>
