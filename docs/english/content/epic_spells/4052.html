<br />You imprison a creature to an extra-planar prison, which you control and have access to. You must have previously made preparations for a prison beforehand (target the ground with a casting to designate the cell's location), or else the spell will fail. Once you have your planar prison prepared, you can begin sending prisoners to it. What you do with the prisoners thereafter is up to you; interrogation, slavery, food, etc. Subjects of this spell must make a Will saving throw to avoid imprisonment. If they fail, they instantly teleport to your planar prison. To discard the cell's location, target yourself with a casting of the spell. This will allow you to designate a new cell at a later time.</div>
