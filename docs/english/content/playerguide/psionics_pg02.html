<br>There are some very major differences between spells and powers.<ul>
	<li>Psionics does not use any slots. Instead all powers cost a number of <i><b>power points</b></i> which varies depending on the power level.
	<table class="table_contenttable">
	<tr><td>Level 1</td><td>1 Power Point</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Level 2</td><td>3 Power Points</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Level 3</td><td>5 Power Points</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Level 4</td><td>7 Power Points</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Level 5</td><td>9 Power Points</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Level 6</td><td>11 Power Points</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Level 7</td><td>13 Power Points</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Level 8</td><td>15 Power Points</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Level 9</td><td>17 Power Points</td></tr>
	</table></li>
	<li>Powers do not scale their effects automatically with manifester level. Instead they must be <i><b>augmented</b></i> by spending extra power points. Durations, however, do usually scale with manifester level.</li>
	<li>You cannot spend more power points on a single power than your manifester level. So don't expect to be able to use all your day's power points on a single power.</li>
	<li>Metapsionics and several other feats require you to expend your <i><b>psionic focus</b></i> when using them or will only work as long as you are psionically focused. To become psionically focused, you must use the Psionic Focus feat that all psionic characters have, and pass a concentration check (DC 20). This may provoke attacks of opportunity from nearby enemies.</li>
	<li>There is a different set of metapsionics than there are metamagics. You cannot apply metamagic to powers or visa versa. Unlike metamagic in NWN, metapsionics can be stacked; however you must have Epic Psionic Focus to expend your psionic focus on more than one thing at a time. The list is:<ul>
		<li>Empower Power</li>
		<li>Extend Power</li>
		<li>Maximize Power</li>
		<li>Quicken Power</li>
		<li>Chain Power</li>
		<li>Split Psionic Ray</li>
		<li>Twin Power</li>
		<li>Widen Power</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Psions (but not wilders or psychic warriors) must select a discipline to specialise in at first level. Unlike spell schools, this does not prevent you selecting powers from other disciplines. Instead, it adds a set of powers specific to your chosen discipline to the list you select from when gaining a level. These powers are by default only available to psions who specialise in that discipline.</li>
	<li>Unlike wizards, all manifesters must select what powers that can use when gaining a level and cannot gain more powers from scrolls or other items. This is similar to a bard or sorcerer.</li>
	<li>There are no summoning powers, the closest thing is astral construct which is a shaper-only power. However, you can design your own astral constructs for all power levels from I to IX including customizing their special abilities.</li>
	<li>There is only one healing power, body adjustment. However, empathic transfer can be used to move your injuries onto your opponents.</li>
	<li>Several powers require the manifester to concentrate to maintain them. This means the power will end if you  cast spells, manifest powers, or do other strenuous activities. The power will also end if you come under the influence of an effect which prevents you from concentrating, such as charm, dominate, confusion, fear, stun, paralysis, or polymorph.</li>
