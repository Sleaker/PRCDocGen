			<div><h1> :: Svirfneblin :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Deep gnomes, known also as svirfneblin, have become understandably distrustful of all strangers after centuries of living with the everyday perils the Underdark. With strangers, most deep gnomes are sullen, reserved and suspicious, almost to a fault. Their skin is the color of the rocks among which they live. They have dark gray eyes, tending towards black. Their hair is of similar color, although it's only seen in a woman as the men are entirely bald and beardless.
