			<div><h1> :: Fireblood Dwarf :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Few dwarves delved as deep as the ancient Fireblood clan.  Particularly fond of dormant volcanos, these dwarves followed volcanic trails and tunnels in search of further access to the world's depths.  Unfortunately they stumbled on a nest of red dragons, and the outraged dragons enslaved the hapless clan to mine treasures for them.  Over time, whether by interbreeding, natural mutation, or magical effect the Fireblood clan began to take on unique traits making them better adapted to higher temperatures... and to battling dragons.  They won their freedom eventually, but the hatred for evil dragons in general and red dragons in specific still burns deep within this breed of dwarf.  The clan intermarried and spread their bloodline across many clans now, however, and a Fireblood dwarf may be born to any dwarf parents.  They are much the same as standard dwarves, but have dark red-brown skin, and are usually bald, with only the faintest of beards.
