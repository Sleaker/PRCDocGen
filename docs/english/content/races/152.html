			<div><h1> :: Gold Dwarf :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Found largely in the south in the immediate vicinity of the Great Rift. Renowned not only for their smithwork and craftsmanship but also for their military progress and legendary wealth, gold dwarves have maintained their empire for millennia, unbowed by the passage of time. The skin of a gold dwarf is light brown or deeply tanned, and her eyes are usually brown or hazel. Both genders wear their hair long; hair color ranges from black to gray or brown, with all shades fading to light gray as time progresses.
<br />

<br />Favored Class (Fighter): A multiclass gold dwarf's fighter class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
