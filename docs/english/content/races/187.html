			<div><h1> :: Orog :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Deep Orcs, also known as orogs, revel in the spoils of war. They are quick to rise to battle, but afterward they fall back to enjoy the fruits of their victories. The concept of leading a horde of raging orcs on a pointless crusade is alien to the mindset of the orog. Orogs looks similar to a large mountain orc, except that the ears are somewhat larger and their eyes are huge and pale.
<br />
<br />Orog Ability Adjustments: +6 Str, +2 Cha, -2 Dex, -2 Wis.
<br />Favored Class (Fighter): A multiclass orog's fighter class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- Darkvision: Orogs are able to see in the dark.
<br />- Skill Affinity (Craft): +2 racial bonus to Craft Armor and Craft Weapon checks.
<br />- Natural Armor Bonus: Racial natural armor bonus of 2.
<br />- Resist Cold: Innate cold resistance of 5.
<br />- Resist Fire: Innate fire resistance of 5.
<br />- Light Blindness: Abrupt exposure to light blinds an orog for 1 round. In addition orogs suffer -1 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, saves and checks while operating in bright light.
<br />- Orcish: Orogs are considered Orcish for the purpose of spells.
<br />
