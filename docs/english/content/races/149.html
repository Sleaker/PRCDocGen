			<div><h1> :: Warforged :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Warforged were originally built as mindless war machines, an army of constructs able to fight without food and water.  As a side-effect of the processes used to create them, however, they gained sentience.  At first this was a boon, as now there was no need for a living general to travel with them, but eventually the war came to an end, as all wars do.  As they couldn't destroy the now-sentient race of living constructs, they were instead freed and left to find their own way in the world.  Physically they look similar to golems, with plating made of metal and mineral covering a living wooden frame.  They were created without gender, though a few with a more typically feminine mindset have modified their design and plating to mimic a humanoid female's shape.  Warforged cannot reproduce, but can only be made at special Creation Forges built using uncovered ancient plans.  They do not age either, and their mindset sometimes leaves the activities of the humanoid races a puzzle to them.
<br />
