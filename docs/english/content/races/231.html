			<div><h1> :: Troll :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Trolls are carnivorous creatures found in all climates, from tundra to desert. Their lack of fear makes them excellent fighters, launching into combat without hesitation. Known for their ravenous appetites, trolls will often establish lairs near settlements in order to hunt the creatures that make their dwelling there. A typical troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with females being slightly larger than males. Their rubbery hide is moss green or putrid gray, and their heir is generally greenish black or iron gray in color.
