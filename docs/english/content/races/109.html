			<div><h1> :: Glimmerskin Halfling :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Gold dragons hate injustice and foul play, but few things anger them more than tyranny of the strong over the weak, or the small.  When a gold dragon's territory includes or is near a halfling village, they often appoint themselves protector and take of threats too powerful for the halflings to handle alone.  Such villages seldom, if ever, learn of those dangers or of their guardian.  The dragon often walks among its charges, appearing as a small animal or as a halfling looking to settle in the town.  While any relationships from this are short-lived as far as the dragon is concerned, the signs of draconic heritage live on long after among the village inhabitants.  These dragonblooded halflings look for the most part like their more mundane kin, but bear a golden sheen to their complexion and inevitably have golden flecks in their eyes.  They also tend to show traits of nobility and courage, standing up to any threat they encounter.
