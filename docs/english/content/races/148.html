			<div><h1> :: Kalashtar :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Kalashtar are a compound race, a fusion of humans and an incorporeal race called the quori, native to a plane of dreams.  Fleeing persecution, they found a way to escape to the Prime, and joined with those humans willing to welcome them.  Now, kalashtar are a race of their own, each having a small portion of the original quori who joined with their ancestors, but due to the quori's exile the kalashtar cannot dream.  Physically they appear like humans for the most part, but are typically a bit taller, with slightly more angular features.  When they move, it is with more than the usual grace and elegance.
