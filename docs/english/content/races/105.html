			<div><h1> :: Stonehunter Gnome :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>One of the few races considered to be fast companions of any kind of dragon, stonehunter gnomes are the favored people of copper dragons.  Since the coppers' love of pranks, riddles, and mischief fit well with the gnomes' outlook on life, it should be no surprise they get along well.  The gnomes who return this sentiment are known as stonehunters, as the two races frequently meet to hunt together.  Copper dragons often make their lairs beneath stonehunter gnome villages, and over time while the gnomes become more dragonlike in appearance the coppers grow fonder of the mortals.  Physically they tend to look like most other gnomes, but for their very dark skin that takes on a coppery sheen in sunlight.
