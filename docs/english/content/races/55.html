			<div><h1> :: Krynn Half-Ogre :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Half-ogres are usually born out of violence and slavery.  Considered weak by ogre standards and a freak despised for their lack of control by human society, they try hard to win acceptance to avoid becoming lonely and depressed.  Their values tend to be set by the culture in which they are raised, which also influences how they prove themselves.  Physically they are a mix, about 6'6" to 7'6" tall.  Half-ogres raised by ogres tend to be unkempt, while human-raised groom as they are taught.  They often try to hide their heritage under large hoods and cloaks.
