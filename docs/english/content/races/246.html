			<div>Nezumi, or "ratlings" as the humans call them, hail from the far east.  They used to control a large empire, which was destroyed in a great cataclysm, leaving the survivors to eke out an existence in the badlands left behind.  They are not physically large, being around 5'5" and 155 pounds in height and weight.  In shape they are humanoid, with a ratlike head, humanlike hands, and long hairless tails.  Their bodies are covered in a rough fur that varies from white, through grey and brown, to black.
