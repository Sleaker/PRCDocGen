			<div><h1> :: Irda :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Irda, also known as high ogres, retain the natural grace and beauty bestowed upon them as one of the first races created on Krynn.  They split from their ogre ancestors long ago, taking up residence on a faraway island and only paying visits in secrecy to the mainland of Ansalon.  They were cast out into the world when Chaos was reborn, destroying their island in the process.  Physically they are tall and slender, moving with a grace and delicacy that even elves envy.  Mentally they are aloof and arrogant, typically considering the other races as squabbling children.  They prefer isolation as well, even among their own kind.
