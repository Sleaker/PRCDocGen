			<div><h1> :: Tinker Gnome :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Tinker gnomes are the tinkers and inventors of Krynn.  Their mind is always awhirl with technological dreams and ideas.  Upon reaching adulthood, every gnome takes up a Life Quest, a goal that they strive towards throughout their entire life.  They are specific and usually outlandish; it's not uncommon for a given Life Quest to be passed through several generations of a family.  Gnomes are typically too focused on their plans and devices to think much of social graces;  it's not that they mean to be rude, the thought just doesn't occur to them.  They also believe that the more complicated it is, the better it is.  Physically, they are like their cousins on other worlds: 3' tall humanoids with teak-colored skin, blue or violet eyes, and long white hair.  Males usually grow a extremely curly beard and moustache.  As a race they tend to speak extremely fast, individual words almost seeming to run together.
