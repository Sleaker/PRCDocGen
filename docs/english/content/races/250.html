			<div>Elans are made, not born.  Living humans are selected from a pool of applicants by a council of elan, and those chosen undergo a secret psionic ritual, transforming them and giving them a new psionically-charged existence.  For some arcane reason only humans are able to undergo the process, and while they retain their basic memories and personality, on the whole they become a completely new person.  Physically they still keep their old appearance, but they are no longer subject to aging, becoming effectively immortal.  They also no longer require sleep, instead meditating in a fashion similar to the elven reverie.
<br />
<br />Elan Ability Adjustments: -2 Cha.
<br />Favored Class (Psion): A multiclass elan's psion class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- 30' base speed
<br />- Naturally Psionic: Elans gain 2 free power points at first level.
<br />- Resistance: Elans can spend 1 power point to give them a +4 to all saving throws until the next round as a free action.
<br />- Resilience: Elans can spend power points to protect themselves from damage.  For each power point spent in this way, they gain 2 temporary hit points, all of which fade after 1 round.
<br />- Aberration: Elans are considered Aberrations for the purpose of spells.</div>
