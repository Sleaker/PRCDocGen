			<div><h1> :: Half-Drow :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>In most lands, half-drow are quite rare. Since many drow are irredeemably evil, they only mate with humans by way of rape or slavery. Half-drow are often as dark-hearted as their elven parents, but with a bitter resentment that comes from being treated as inferior members of drow society. Despite this, good half-drow are much less rare than good drow. Half-drow have dusky skin, silver or white hair and a broad range of eye colors.
