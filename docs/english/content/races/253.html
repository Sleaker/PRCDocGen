			<div><h1> :: Xeph :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Xephs are a race of athletes and artisans, renowned for their feats in agility and speed, as well as their sense of humor.  They value the arts highly, similar to elves, but when betrayed are as implacable as dwarves.  Physically they stand around five and a half feet tall, with a slender build.  They typically sport dark eyes and hair, matching their brown-colored skin.
<br />
<br />Xeph Ability Adjustments: +2 Dex, -2 Str.
<br />Favored Class (Soulknife): A multiclass xeph's soulknife class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- 30' base speed
<br />- Darkvision: Xephs are able to see in the dark.
<br />- Naturally Psionic: Xephs gain 1 free power point at first level.
<br />- Hardiness against Spells: +1 to save vs all spells and spell-like abilities.
<br />- Burst: Three times per day, for up to 3 rounds a Xeph can increase his speed, depending on his level.  33% at levels 1-4, 66% at levels 5-8, up to a max of 100% at levels 9 and greater.
<br />- Humanoid: Xephs are considered Humanoids for the purpose of spells.</div>
