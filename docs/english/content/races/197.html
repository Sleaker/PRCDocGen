			<div><h1> :: Tuladhara :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>The Tuladhara are among the rarest of planetouched; a crossbreed between humans and the enigmatic rilmani, the neutral exemplars.  To them, balance is everything.  They are not emotionless, but almost always consider all sides of an issue, acting without bias.  Unlike some rumors may have you believe, however, they do not betray trust and friendship easily.  Physically they resemble lithe and graceful humans, and are sometimes mistaken at a distance for half-elves.  Up close, metallic-colored skin and opalescent eyes give them away.  They are balanced in dress as in all things; not too flashy, but still fashionable.
