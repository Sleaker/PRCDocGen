			<div><h1> :: Kapak Draconian :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Kapak Draconians are a race of dragon-like humanoids created originally from the eggs of copper dragons. They make good assassins and thieves, as they can coat their weapons with a form of poison, which paralyzes a victim. They like structure, and while not renowned for original thought, they still show creativity in carrying out missions of stealth and subterfuge.  Kapaks are larger than Baaz draconians (though smaller than Sivaks) and powerfully muscled; they tend to enjoy battle, but they are not particularly perceptive. When a Kapak is killed, it immediately dissolves into a pool of acid and all equipment it carried becomes useless. The saliva of female Kapaks is not poisonous; instead, it has healing properties.
<br />
<br />Kapak Draconian Ability Adjustments: +2 Dex, +2 Con, -2 Int, -2 Wis.
<br />Favored Class (Rogue): A multiclass kapak's rogue class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- 30' base speed
<br />- Darkvision: Allows them to see in the dark.
<br />- Spell Resistance: Kapaks have spell resistance equal to 11 + their level.
<br />- Natural Armor: +2 racial bonus to Natural Armor.
<br />- Natural Weapons: Has a bite attack for 1d4.
<br />- Sneak Attack: Kapaks gain 1d6 sneak attack damage to their attacks.
<br />- Immunities: Immune to sleep, paralyzation, and disease.
<br />- Saliva: Male Kapaks have poisonous saliva.  When used on a weapon it coats it with a poison that does 1d6 Dex primary and 1d6 secondary damage.  Female Kapaks have a healing saliva instead of poisonous, healing 2d6 points of damage.  This healing only works once every 4 hours on any given creature, and does not work on the kapak herself.
<br />- Death Throes: When a kapak dies, he melts into a pool of acid with a radius of 5'.  The acid lasts 1d6 rounds before evaporating, and does 1d6 acid points damage to anything in it each round.
<br />- Proficiencies: Proficient with all simple weapons.
<br />- Dragon: Kapak Draconians count as Dragons for the purpose of spells.
