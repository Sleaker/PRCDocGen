			<div><h1> :: Fire Genasi :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Fire genasi are usually thought of as hot-blooded and quick to anger, and they have earned that reputation. Mercurial, proud and often fearless, they are not content to sit and watch the world pass by them by. Fire genasi are obviously not human, having mostly human features except for one or two exceptional traits related to their elemental ancestors like: charcoal gray or deep red or skin, red or orange hair or large red teeth.
<br />
<br />Fire Genasi Ability Adjustments: +2 Int, -2 Cha.
<br />Favored Class (Fighter): A multiclass fire genasi's fighter class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Note: Genasi clerics must have the relevant elemental domain.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- Darkvision: Fire Genasi can see in the dark.
<br />- Hardiness vs. Fire: +1 racial bonus on saving throws against fire spells (additional +1 for every 5 levels).
<br />- Outsider: Fire Genasi are considered Outsiders for the purpose of spells.
<br />- Human: Fire Genasi are considered Human for the purpose of spells.
<br />
<br />(The following may or may not be in use, depending on the module switch settings)
<br />Level Adjustment: +1
<br />Racial Hit Dice/Class: NA</div>
