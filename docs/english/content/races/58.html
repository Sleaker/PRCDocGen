			<div>Dragonkin are large humanoid creatures believed to be cousins to dragons.  Standing 8 to 9 feet tall, they are covered with a scaled hide that could be colored anywhere from dark yellow ochre to reddish brown, sometimes with darker spots or bands.  Their heads are decidedly draconic in shape, with a mane of thick hair behind small horns.  Their wings vary from gold and green, to colors that match their scales.  They tend to either live in barbarian tribes or serve human masters.
