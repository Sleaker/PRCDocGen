			<div>Muls are a cross between humans and dwarves, force-bred to be slaves and gladiators.  They combine human height and adaptability with dwarven musculature and resilience.  Unlike other half-breeds, they are sterile, so the only way to make more is to breed more humans and dwarves.  Muls are stoic and dull to pain, able to easily ignore bruises and other pains of life due to their raising.  Even those that find freedom still are rarely able to escape their past, as each is marked with tattoos showing their history, owners, and so on.  Even untattooed muls are valuable to slavers, as its cheaper to "retrieve" an "escaped" mul than to try and breed a new one.  Physically they are second only to the half-giant in strength, and range in height up to 7' tall and 250 pounds in weight.  They carry almost no fat, and are often hairless, with copper-colored skin.  Common facial features include angular, almost protrusive eye ridges, and ears that point sharply backwards against the temples.
