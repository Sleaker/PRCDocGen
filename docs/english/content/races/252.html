			<div><h1> :: Maenad :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Maenads are an emotional people, though at first glance they seem very reserved.  This is because they bottle their wild tempest of emotions within themselves, only releasing it when necessary, or when unable to restrain it further.  Physically they are tall and wiry, standing around 6'.  They tend to wear their dark hair long and braided, and their skin is sparkles with flecks of living crystal embedded in it.
<br />

<br />Favored Class (Wilder): A multiclass maenad's wilder class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
