			<div><h1> :: Illithid :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Illithid, known commonly as mind flayers, are so insidious, diabolical and powerful that all denizens of the dark fear them. They bend others to their will and shatter enemies' minds. Despite their strange appearance, with greenish-mauve rubbery flesh and tentacled head, illithids are quite charismatic and able to persuade others to follow their demands. This is due to their innate psionic ability to read and control the thoughts or lesser creatures. Illithids are utterly self-serving and do not make for loyal companions. They congregate in small underground cities where the population is swollen by the overwhelming number of slaves. The centre of every illithid community is a powerful elder brain.
