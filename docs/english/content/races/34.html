			<div><h1> :: Athasian Elf :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>For the elves of Athas, running is life.  If an elf is injured and can't keep up, they are left behind to die, and riding an animal is considered one of the greatest dishonors.  When there is no need though, these elves tend to just laze around and live in the now.  They tend to keep to their own kind unless they have an angle to pursue.  Once their trust is earned, they do not betray it, but if they are betrayed, that same trust is gone forever.  As a race they idolize Coraanu Star Racer, a warrior-thief as the epitome of elfness and honor him in song and deed, raiding and trading with aplomb.  Physically they are taller than otherplanar elves, standing between 6'-7' with lean builds and angular facial features.
<br />
