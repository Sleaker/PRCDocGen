			<div><h1> :: Chaond :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Sometimes, when the implanted eggs of slaadi are removed from their victim, they leave behind some remnants of chaos, which in turn affect said victim's descendants, resulting in the planetouched race of chaonds.  Their chaotic heritage leaves them whimsical and emotional, living for the present.  They seldom look past today, and while they are outgoing they also tend to be insensitive, making no excuses and expecting nothing from others.  Physically they typically appear as rough humans with thick chests and limbs, blocky faces, and skin and hair that slowly shifts in color.  They stand about 5'1" to 5'10" and are usually twice as wide as a normal human.  Other features showing their slaadi heritage vary from chaond to chaond as befits their chaotic nature, and could be anything from patches of hardened scales, to reptilian hands and feet.  Clothing-wise they just wear whatever is at hand, tending to leave them wearing wild and clashing colors.
