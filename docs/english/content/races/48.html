			<div><h1> :: Gully Dwarf :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Gully dwarves are a misbegotten race of tough survivors, said to have descended from gnome/dwarf crossbreeds born after the gnomes' transformation by the Graygem of Gargath.  Gully dwarves are renowned around Ansalon for their stupidity, including the fact that their entire numbering system consists of the number one, and two, which represents any number more than one.  They are proud of themselves despite their self-image, and are hardy survivors, small clans taking root wherever they find room.  Ironically, despite all that, they are the best cooks in Krynn.  Physically they are much like other dwarves, but typically have a lot of scars, boils, warts, and so on on their skin due to their living conditions.  Males tend to grow long scruffy beards, while females have wispy tufts of hair on their cheeks.  Unlike their brethren, they also tend towards thinness in their limbs, and potbellies are common among both genders.
