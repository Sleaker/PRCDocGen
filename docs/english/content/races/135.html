			<div><h1> :: Nymph :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Nymphs are nature's embodiment of physical beauty, and are the guardians of the sacred places of the wild.  They hate evil, and take a dim view on those who despoil nature.  Those who respect the wilds however are often shown kindness, but a nymph's demeanor is mercurial and could change at a moment's notice.  They are most friendly towards elves, half-elves, and druids, knowing them for friends of nature.  Physically nymphs are about the size and weight of a female elf, and are always female themselves.  They are so unbearably lovely they can blind onlookers if the nymph does not take precautions, and the glance of an angry nymph can stun almost any creature.
