			<div><h1> :: Shadowswyft :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Shadowswyft are planetouched beings with ancestry from the Plane of Shadow. They are mercurial in temperament and delight in living in the moment. As a result, they are poor planners and have little patience for strategy. Shadowswyfts bear little resemblance to other races, although they are lean with chiseled features, much like elves. The average male stands about 6 feet tall and weights 165 pounds. They have skin ranging from brown to black, with blackened, slanted eyes - a build perfectly suited for hiding amongst shadows. Unlike most species, shadowswyfts are amiable towards most other races, seeing individual actions as more important than blood lineage.
