			<div><h1> :: Athasian Dwarf :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Dwarves native to the world of Athas are a stubborn, devoted lot.  They prefer meaningful tasks, and dive into them with an intensity seldom seen in other races.  Every dwarf has a "focus" a goal that they devote their entire being to until it is accomplished, and seldom let anything stand in their way.  Dwarves only share the subject of their focus with their closest friends and allies, and a dwarf who dies before completing their focus haunts the object of it until it is finished.  Physically they are much like dwarves of other planes, but unlike their distant kin they are completely hairless, and find the idea of hair repulsive.  Their skin is usually deeply tanned, and decorated with tattoos.
