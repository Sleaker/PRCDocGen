			<div><h1> :: Silverbrow Human :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Silver dragons are well known for taking humanoid form and living among them.  Long ago, communities of humans welcomed silver dragons into their homes, not knowing the nature of their disguised visitors.  In these communities, often secluded and small, half-dragon children became common as the dragons married their human friends.  The silvers did their best to protect these children form discovery, eventually teaching them to assume full human form magically, and thus the mingling of human and silver dragon blood continued.  Over time, the draconic features disappeared, and the dragons moved on as well, leaving communities of humans with dragonblood heritage.  They came to be known as Silverbrow humans due to the white streaks or highlights displayed in the hair of these descendants.  Physically they are otherwise indistinguishable from normal humans.
