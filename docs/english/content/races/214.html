			<div><h1> :: Orc :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Orcs are aggressive humanoids with a reputation for war and destruction. They are stronger than their Half-Orc cousins but not as wise to the world beyond their surroundings. An orc's hair is usually black and he sports lupine ears with reddish eyes. Orcs believe that survival depends on conquering as much territory as possible, which makes relations with other creatures very difficult. Orcs often make their home in caves but are capable of building organized cities below ground. They wear their battle scars proudly as signs of achievement.
<br />
<br />Orc Ability Adjustments: +4 Str, -2 Int, -2 Cha, -2 Wis.
<br />Favored Class (Barbarian): A multiclass orc's barbarian class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- Darkvision: Orcs are able to see in the dark.
<br />- Light Sensitivity: Orcs suffer -2 penalty to attack rolls, saves and checks while operating in bright light.
<br />- Orcish: Orcs are considered Orcish for the purpose of spells.</div>
