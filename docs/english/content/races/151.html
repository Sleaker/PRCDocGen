			<div><h1> :: Arctic Dwarf :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Native from mountains at the heart of the great glacier and other northerly regions, arctic dwarves are little known to the outside world. Unlike other dwarves, arctic dwarves have little interest in mining or crafts, instead devoting themselves to hunting, raising children and leisure. Traditional dwarven strictures, such as those imposed by family and clan hold little weight in arctic dwarf society. Arctic Dwarves are squat and hardy, with blocky bodies, pinched faces and
<br />stubby legs. They rarely exceed 3 feet in height and are nearly as broad as they are tall. They eyes are bright blue and their skin white, almost bluish.
<br />
<br />Arctic Dwarven Ability Adjustments: +4 Str, +2 Con, -2 Cha, -2 Dex.
<br />Favored Class (Ranger): A multiclass arctic dwarf's ranger class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
