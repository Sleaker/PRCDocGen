			<div><h1> :: Athasian Halfling :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Athasian halflings are masters of the jungles of the Ringing Mountains.  They are small, quick, and agile, and have a ancient culture that goes back far before the start of the current desolation.  They are a insular and xenophobic race, worried more about their own kind than members of other races, and easily become frustrated with the other "uncivilized" races who don't know all the nuances and other aspects of halfling culture.  They are also very uncomfortable with change, but still some leave their mountain home and journey into the Tablelands.  Physically they are like the halflings of other worlds, but they tend to paint their skin in bright reds and greens.
