			<div><h1> :: Rock Gnome :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Rock gnomes are the most common of their race in Faerun. Although many adventuring gnomes have taken up illusionary magic, most gnomes prefer the bardic life. Gnomes adore animals, gems, and jokes, especially pranks. They love to learn by personal experience, and are always trying new ways to build things. Gnomes stand 3 to 3 1/2 feet tall, with skin that ranges from dark tan to woody brown. Their hair is fair, and their eyes are often some shade of blue. Gnomes generally wear earth tones, but decorate their clothes intricately. Males favor carefully-trimmed beards. Gnomes live 350 to 500 years.
