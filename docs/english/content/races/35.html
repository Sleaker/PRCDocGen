			<div><h1> :: Athasian Half-Elf :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Half-elves on the world of Athas are notorious loners.  Partly this stems form a lack of self-confidence due to their mixed blood.  Their elven blood makes them distrusted among humans, while elven tradition demands they be abandoned.  They will cooperate with companions, but find it difficult to rely on anyone.  Many find companionship among the animals, these skills lending themselves well to being beast handlers in human society. Physically they are bulkier than elves, standing around 6' tall.  Usually they find it easier to pass themselves off as humans, but they always have some features that hint at their heritage.
