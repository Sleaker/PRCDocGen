			<div><h1> :: Earth Genasi :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Earth genasi are patient, stubborn and contemplative in their decision making. Marked at birth with obvious traits reflecting their heritage, earth genasi are often shunned by others, but their physical gifts make them able to defend themselves against most attackers. Earth genasi are obviously not human, but have mostly human features except for one or two distinguishing traits related to their elemental ancestors like earthlike skin, eyes like black pits or gems, very large hand or feet, iron gray hair or metallic sheen to skin or hair.
<br />
<br />Earth Genasi Ability Adjustments: +2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Cha, -2 Wis.
<br />Favored Class (Fighter): A multiclass earth genasis fighter class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Note: Genasi clerics must have the relevant elemental domain.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- Darkvision: Earth Genasi can see in the dark.
