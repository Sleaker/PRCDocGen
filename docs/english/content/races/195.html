			<div><h1> :: Bladeling :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Bladelings are dangerous inhabitants of the Lower Plane of Acheron.  Like their home plane they are mostly made of metal, resembling living constructs.  In shape they are human, but lack hair, and their skin is covered in patches of metallic spines.  Their eyes typically glow a blue or purple light.  They have little interest in superficial clothing, and many rely on their natural armor for protection.  As a race they are xenophobic and distrusting of outsiders, though they have a strong sense of duty and loyalty to their own kind.  They are also highly superstitious.
<br />
<br />Bladeling Ability Adjustments: +2 Dex.
<br />Favored Class (Fighter): A multiclass bladeling's fighter class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- 30' base speed
<br />- Darkvision: Bladelings are able to see in the dark.
<br />- Natural Armor: Bladelings have a +4 Natural Armor bonus.
<br />- Natural Weapons: Bladelings have a primary natural claw attack for 1d6 damage.
<br />- Immunities: Immune to acid damage.
<br />- Resist Fire: Innate fire resistance of 5.
<br />- Resist Cold: Innate cold resistance of 5.
<br />- Damage Reduction: DR 5/+1.
<br />- Metal Hide: Despite their metal skin, bladelings themselves cannot be damaged by rust attacks.  They also cannot wear any armor heavier than light armor due to the spikes in their skin.
<br />- Razor Storm: Once per day, bladelings can expel a 15' cone of metallic shards from their skin, dealing 2d6 slashing to those within.  There is a reflex save vs 10 + Con for half damage.  Afterwards, the bladeling's natural armor drops by 2 for 24 hours.
<br />- Outsider: Bladelings count as Outsiders for the purpose of spells.
