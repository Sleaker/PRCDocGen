			<div>Half-ogres are the product of human and ogre crosses. They are generally slow to think but quick to anger. Half-ogres are exceptionally strong and large, yet enjoy simple pleasures such as feasting, drinking, boasting, wrestling, drumming and wild dancing. A half-ogre skin color ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their thick hides sport patches of dark, warty dumps and they generally have dark hair.
<br />
