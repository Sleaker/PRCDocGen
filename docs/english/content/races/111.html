			<div><h1> :: Sunscorch Hobgoblin :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Hobgoblins often ally with powerful dragons, to both sides' mutual benefit, with blue dragons being the most common due to shared territories.  Although physical relationships are extremely rare between the two, a tribe of hobgoblins developed a series of rituals to allow them to take on aspects of dragonkind.  This original tribe is long since gone, but the traits left behind by the rituals live on among the hobgoblin race.  The birth of a Sunscorch Hobgoblin is considered a omen, and they are often leaders or the power behind the leader of a given tribe.  They look like their fellows, but for brilliant azure eyes.  They are more cunning and patient than normal hobgoblins, but they also inherited the blue dragon's vanity.
