			<div><h1> :: Drow, Female :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Descended from the original dark-skinned subrace called the Illythiiri, the drow also known as dark elves, were cursed into their present appearance by the good elven deities for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Living in the Underdark, they built a matriarchal society based on power and deceit. The drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be often mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink and blue. They also tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.
<br />
<br />Drow females tend to be bigger and stronger than males. Drow society is theocratic and strongly matriarchal with females holding all positions of power and responsibility in the government, the militia and in the home. Their preferred class is cleric.
<br />Drow males tend to be smaller and weaker than females. In society they tend to fill the lower ranks as fighters, rangers and rogues although their aptitude for magic is equal, if not superior, to that of other elven subraces. Their preferred class is wizard.
