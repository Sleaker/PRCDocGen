			<div><h1> :: Kender :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Kender are like the children or Krynn.  They have short attention spans, intense curiosity, and a fearlessness that leads them into and out of more troubles than a dragon could count.  You never want to hear a kender say "Oops."  They will leave no chest unlocked, and no shiny object unhandled.  They have a tendency to pick up things that don't belong to them, but don't consider it stealing, and dislike thieves as much as anyone else.  They instead consider it borrowing, as they fully intend to return it; just with so much going on in the world to see, they sometimes forget for a long time.  They are creatures of extremes, and other creatures tend to get caught up in their moods.  They are also horrible at keeping secrets.  Physically, kender are similar to halflings of other worlds.  They stand between 3' and 4', rarely going up to 5'.  Their hair runs the gamut form light brown and blond, to coppery red, with styles ranging from short-cropped to long.  Their eyes are usually a blue or hazel color, and their clothes are typically flamboyant.  Aware of the importance of first impressions, when a kender first meets someone new, their first instinct is to brush themselves off, straighten their clothes, and offer a hand to the new person.
