			<div><h1> :: Krynn Minotaur :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Minotaurs from the world of Krynn are an honorable race.  They are a warrior culture, and promote bravery, glory, and honor.  if they are fighting for a cause they believe in, they will dedicate themselves to that cause.  They are also natural sailors.  They believe that they are superior to all other races, though they respect dwarves for their ruggedness and humans for their sailing ability and military skills.  Physically they are smaller than their cousins on other worlds, between 6'6" and 7' tall typically, though just as powerfully built, relatively.  They tend to dress austerely, preferring a simple harness and skirt or kilt, though nobles will occasionally wear robes.
