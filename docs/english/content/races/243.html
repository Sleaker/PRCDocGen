			<div><h1> :: Spirit Folk :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Spirit folk are the descendants of humans and various spirits of nature.  They come in three specific subtypes, each of which has a slight affinity to a different element, granting a bonus to saves vs that element and another additional ability.  They tend to be serene and calm, in tune with their surroundings, and show little desire of manipulating them with magic.  Physically they look human, with small mouths and slender eyes.  They tend to have a fair or golden complexion, and no body hair, though the hair on their head is fairly luxurious.
<br />
<br />Spirit Folk Ability Adjustments: None.
<br />Favored Class (Any): A multiclass spirit folk's highest class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />- Low-Light Vision: Allows them to see better than normal in the dark.
<br />- Human: Spirit Folk are considered Human for the purpose of spells.</div>
