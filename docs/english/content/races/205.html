			<div><h1> :: Water Genasi :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Water genasi are patient and independent, used to solving problems on their own and not afraid to take a lot of time doing so. At times they are fierce and destructive like terrible storms, but more often than not they present a tranquil appearance, despite whatever emotions run underneath that quiet surface. Water genasi look human except one distinguishing feature related to their elemental ancestor like: blue-green skin or hair, large black-blue eyes or clammy flesh.
<br />
<br />Air Genasi Ability Adjustments: +2 Con. -2 Cha.
<br />Favored Class (Fighter): A multiclass water genasi's fighter class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Note: Genasi clerics must have the relevant elemental domain.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- Darkvision: Water Genasi can see in the dark.
<br />- Hardiness vs. Water: +1 racial bonus on saving throws against water and cold spells (additional +1 for every 5 levels).
<br />- Water Breathing: Creature can breath water and is therefore immune to the effects of Drown and Mass Drown.
<br />- Outsider: Water Genasi are considered Outsiders for the purpose of spells.
<br />- Human: Water Genasi are considered Human for the purpose of spells.
<br />
