			<div>The nathri are a crude and savage race native to the ethereal plane, living in hunting packs that hunt intruders to their realm.  Rumors say they sprung from the deep ethereal itself.  Physically they are small, standing around 4' tall, with green skin and dark unruly hair.  They have wide faces with flat noses and long pointed ears.  The only clothing they wear is that scavenged from their victims, with many pouches and bags for their few possessions.
