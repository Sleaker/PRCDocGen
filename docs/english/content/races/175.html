			<div><h1> :: Forest Gnome :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Forest Gnomes have a great love for nature, particularly deep and quiet forests far from civilization or even anyone's home. For this reason many people, including others of their kind, have never seen a forest gnome. Unlike other gnomes, forest gnomes wear their hair and beards long, often to the almost to their feet when unbound. The males often trim their beards to a fine point or curl them into hornlike spikes extending to either side of their faces. Their skin is the color of bark, and their eyes are usually brown or blue. Their hair is brown or black, becoming gray or white with age.
