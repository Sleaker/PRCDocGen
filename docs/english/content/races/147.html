			<div><h1> :: Changeling :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Changelings are a true-breeding race descended from human and doppelganger ancestry.  while they lack the full shifting capability of a doppelganger, they are still able to significantly alter their form, up to changing genders.  Also, unlike doppelgangers, they have a defined gender in their natural form.  This ability to assume another's shape makes them excellent at subterfuge.  In their true form, they stand between 5 and 6 feet, with pale grey skin, and thin, fair hair.  Their limbs are long and slightly out of proportion, and their facial features appear melted or somewhat unfinished, including blank white eyes.
<br />
<br />Changeling Ability Adjustments: None.
<br />Favored Class (Rogue): A multiclass changeling's rogue class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- Base movement of 30.
<br />- Slippery Mind: Changelings gain a +2 racial bonus to save vs mind-affecting abilities due to their slippery minds.
<br />- Body Language: Changelings are adept at reading body language and attitude, and gain a +2 to all Bluff, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks.
<br />- Minor Shape Change: Changelings can physically alter their form to mimic someone of a similar size and mass, as if using a Disguise Self spell.
<br />- Shapeshifter: Changelings are considered Shapeshifters for the purpose of spells.</div>
