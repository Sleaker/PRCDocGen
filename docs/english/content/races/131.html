			<div><h1> :: Volodni :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>At the end of a terrible war, a great lord led his people into the great forests of the former ancient empire to seek refuge from the roving demons and magical plagues ravaging the lands.  Some power of the old woods, whether an elder treant or something greater, confronted the refugees and denied them safety unless they forswore their demon-summoning ways and took on the forests' blood for their own.  The lord agreed on the spot, and thus the refugees gave up their humanity for safety, becoming the Volodni.  In shape they still resemble humans, but their skin is the deep olive green of a pine needle, and is woody and tough.  They bear sap for blood, and their hair grows in long, thick locks scaled like bark on a young tree.  Their eyes are gleaming black and they tend to be tall and wiry.  They tend to be cold and dispassionate, believing the ends serve the means, and go about their tasks with the patience of the forest itself.  To the "pine folk" as they are sometimes known, the forest is everything.
