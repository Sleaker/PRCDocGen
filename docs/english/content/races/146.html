			<div><h1> :: Shifter :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Shifters are the distant descendants of lycanthropes and humans, sometimes called the weretouched.  They can no longer fully change form, but instead take on aspects of it in a unique ability called shifting.  They are a unique race that breeds true, and prefer to form small communities and villages out in the wilds rather than live in cities.  Their personality tends to be influenced by the animal they relate to.  They are basically humanoid in shape, but move in a crouched posture, springing and leaping while their companions walk alongside normally.  Their faces have a bestial cast, with wide, flat noses, large eyes, pointed ears, and long sideburns on both genders.  Their forearms and lower legs grow long hair, and they wear their hair on their head thick and long.
<br />
<br />Shifter Ability Adjustments: +2 Dex, -2 Int, -2 Cha.
<br />Favored Class (Ranger): A multiclass shifter's ranger class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- Base movement of 30.
<br />- Shifting: Shifters can assume aspects of their lycanthropic heritage.  This grants them a bonus to one stat for 3+Con rounds, usable once per day.  Shifter feats can extend the time and add uses per day, as well as add other effects.
<br />- Low-Light Vision: Shifters can see better than normal in the dark.
<br />- Animalistic Heritage: Shifters gain a +2 to Jump and Balance from their feral heritage.
<br />- Shapeshifter: Shifters are considered Shapeshifters for the purpose of spells.</div>
