			<div><h1> :: Pterran :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Pterrans are a reptilian race native to Athas, specifically to the region called the Hinterlands.  They rarely leave their home villages, but recent natural disasters have inspired more than the rare few to enter the Tablelands.  They are typically subdued and cautious among unfamiliar people, but when among friends they are optimistic, open, friendly, and inquisitive.  Each Pterran chooses a life path that defines their personality, or perhaps the other way around.  Warrior pterrans are the least disturbed by the brutality of the Tablelands, and take pleasure in military strategy.  Druidic pterrans are most concerned with nature, and take the greatest pleasure when they eliminate a threat to it.  Psionic pterrans are the most social, and take the greatest pleasure in intellectual pursuits such as solving riddles and resolving disputes.  Physically they are anywhere between 5' and 6'6" tall, with light brown scaly skin.  They wear little clothing, preferring sashes and loincloths, and have a finlike growth on the back of their head.  There is no visible distinction between males and females.
