			<div><h1> :: Poison Dusk Lizardfolk :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Poison Dusk Lizardfolk are smaller and more cunning than normal lizardfolk.  They stand between 3' and 4' in height, weighing between 42 and 52 lbs.  Their tails are 2'-3' long, and their scales change color with their mood.  Their eyes are proportionally larger than those of other species, and males have a crest that runs down the back of their head that can lie flat or extend based on mood.  They consider themselves the superior breed of lizardfolk, and are sometimes servants to dragons.
