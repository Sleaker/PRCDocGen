			<div>Hobgoblins are the larger cousins of goblins, and far more aggressive. They are at constant war with elves and harbor a deep hatred of them. Hobgoblins stand over 6 feet tall, with reddish-brown hair and fur-covered hide. These creatures have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics, and are capable of developing sophisticated battle plans. Their society is geared toward military activities, with young being raised for battle. Under the leadership of a skilled warrior, hobgoblin bands can be formidable opponents.
