			<div><h1> :: Forestlord Elf :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Like most sylvan races, the elves are in tune with the natural world, which includes dragonkind.  In ancient times a few groups of elves forged treaties with powerful green dragons, who in turn granted those elves strange new powers.  Though the elves did not and do not worship those dragons, the peace accords they crafted last to this day, long after those who signed them died.  Every descendent of a forestlord can be one, although this is far from certain, as the traits themselves are unpredictable.  Physically, they appear much like regular elves, but can be easily distinguished by their smooth green skin, similar to green dragon scales.  Most have green hair as well, though occasionally it can be anywhere from brown to white.
