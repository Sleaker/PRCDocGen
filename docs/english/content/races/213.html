			<div><h1> :: Goblin :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Goblins are small creatures that many consider to be little more than a nuisance. Standing just over 3 feet and weighing less than 50 pounds, these creatures are seldom intimidating on their own but can be cunningly lethal in larger numbers. Their skin tone ranges from yellow to deep red, and they prefer to wear colors that blend into their natural surroundings of dark caverns. Often bullied by the larger races, goblins have learned to exploit their advantages, usually in the form of sheer numbers and ingenuity.
