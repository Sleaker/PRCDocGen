			<div><h1> :: Zenythri :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>The Zenythri are a human-like race, infused with the energies of Law.  No one knows where they come from, with rumors ranging from mysterious rituals, to the effects of distant parts of the Lawful planes.  As a race they devote their lives to self-perfection, and view their role as to bring order to the universe, through example, or possibly other means.  Physically they resemble perfectly-formed humans, with even their hair falling naturally into their personal style.  Their skin is usually tinted a bluish-purple, and rarely they have other features showing their planetouched heritage such as metallic colored hair or eyes.  They usually dress in simple and elegant clothing, and tend to either set or follow the local fashion.
