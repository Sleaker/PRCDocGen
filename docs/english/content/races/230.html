			<div><h1> :: Deep Imaskari :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>The deep Imaskari are heirs to the lost empire of Imaskari. One of the earliest human empires, the Imaskari were destroyed by the slaves they had abducted from other worlds. A few, however, managed to preserve themselves and their kin. Fleeing deep into the bowels of the earth, they sealed themselves away from both the knowledge and the recriminations of the surface world. A deep Imaskari appears mostly human tall and slender. Her skin looks pale and stone like, as if expertly sculpted from the finest veined marble, though it is as soft as human skin to the touch.
<br />
<br />Deep Imaskari Ability Adjustments: +2 Int, -2 Dex.
<br />Favored Class (Wizard): A multiclass imaskari's wizard class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />- Skill Affinity (Hide): +2 racial bonus to Hide checks.
<br />- Skill Affinity (Hide Underground): +4 racial bonus to Hide checks when underground
<br />- Low-Light Vision: Allows them to see better than normal in the dark.
<br />- Human: Imaskari are considered Human for the purpose of spells.</div>
