			<div><h1> :: Githyanki :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Githyanki are tall, gaunt humanoids from an ancient line of being from the Astral Plane. Built roughly like humans, they are elaborate dressers and have a passion for fine weapons. They have yellowish skin and russet hair, with pointed eyes that resemble those of an elf but are serrated at the back. The gith empire arose from slave rebellion against their master mind flayers. Once free, the gith split into two distinct races - the githyanki and githzerai. The githyanki live within massive fortresses adrift in the Astral Plane and have been known to form alliances with Red Dragons.
