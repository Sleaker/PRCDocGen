			<div><h1> :: Half-Giant :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>A cross between humans and giants, this race was bred into existence by a group of desert sorcerer-kings wanting a race of warriors and laborers.  A few however found that the breeding had somehow awakened a spark of psionic power within them, and used it to escape their slavery and forge a new life for themselves.  Physically they stand about 7-8' tall, sometimes being mistaken for a well-groomed Hill Giant.  Despite their appearance, they are as quick of mind as any human, and usually retain human sensibilities.
