			<div><h1> :: Buomman :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Buommans are a race of humanoids native to the Astral plane, presumably descended from humans.  They are known by some as the "moaning monks" and do not speak conventionally, only through voiceless melody.  They make their homes in temples and shrines made of astral debris, which they believe to be the mortal forms of long forgotten or dead deities.  Physically they resemble stretched-out humans, despite actually being slightly shorter and heavier.
<br />
<br />Buomman Ability Adjustments: +2 Wis, -2 Cha
<br />Favored Class (Monk): A multiclass buomman's monk class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- Low-Light Vision: Allows them to see better than normal in the dark.
<br />- Skill Affinity (Listen): +2 racial bonus to Listen checks.
<br />- Skill Affinity (Perform): +2 racial bonus to Perform checks.
<br />- Vow of Silence: Buommans take a vow of silence at an early age, and thereafter do not ever speak conventionally again.  A Buomman spellcaster who wishes to cast spells with verbal components must have the Silent Spell feat to do so.
<br />- Outsider: Buommans count as Outsiders for the purpose of spells.</div>
