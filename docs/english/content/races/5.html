			<div><h1> :: Half-Orc :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Half-orcs are the short-tempered and sullen result of human and orc pairings. They would rather act than ponder and would rather fight than argue. They love simple pleasures, such as feasting, boasting, and wild dancing. They are an asset at the right sort of party, but not at the duchess's grand ball. Half-orcs are as tall as humans but their brutish features betray their lineage. They also regard scars as tokens of pride and things of beauty. They rarely reach 75 years in age.
<br />
<br />Orcish Ability Adjustments: +2 Str, -2 Int, -2 Cha.
<br />Favored Class (Barbarian): A multiclass half-orc's barbarian class does not count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.
<br />
<br />Special Abilities:
<br />
<br />- Darkvision: Half-orcs are able to see in the dark.</div>
