			<div><h1> :: Dark Dwarf :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Native to the world of Krynn, these dwarves prefer to live completely in darkness, and are considered mad by other Krynn dwarves.  They have a reputation for evil and murderous acts, and have betrayed their own kind in the past, but still they claim loyalty to the High Thane and the dwarven race.  Physically they are extremely fair, with the occasional albino being born to them.
