			<div><h1> :: Gray Orc :: </h1></div><br />
			<div>Although gray orcs are comfortable with the savage life of the barbarian, they tend to be more calm and collected than northern orcs, focusing their rage and hatred inward. A gray orc looks less bestial than their more savage kin, but is still obviously nonhuman. Their faces are less porcine than the mountain orcs, with the exception of their tusks. They have yellow, orange or red eyes, lupine ears and black or gray hair.
<br />
