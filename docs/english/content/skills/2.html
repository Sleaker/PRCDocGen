<br />Requires Training: Yes.
<br />Classes: All.
<br />
<br />This skill allows the character to perform a variety of actions on a trap.
<br />
<br />Check: There are four progressively difficult actions that a character may perform on a trap; base DC is determined by the difficulty rating of the trap, modified by the action being performed.
<br />- Assessing a trap to determine its difficulty modifies the DC by -7.
<br />- Flagging a trap to make it visible to the rest of the party modifies the DC by -5.
<br />- Recovering a trap raises the trap DC by +10.
<br />- Disarming a trap has no effect on the trap DC.
<br />
<br />Special: A rogue is the only class capable of disarming traps with a DC of 35 or greater. With 5 or more ranks in the Set Trap skill a character gets a +2 synergy bonus on Disable Trap checks.
<br />Spectacular Failure: When disarming or recovering a trap, a spectacular failure results in the trap immediately going off.
<br />Use: Assess, Flag, Recover, and Disarm are radial menu options off of a detected trap.</div>
