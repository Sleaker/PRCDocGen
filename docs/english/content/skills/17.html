<br />A successful Spot check reveals a hidden creature. 
<br />
<br />Check: The DC is determined by the Hide check of the hidden creature.
<br />Special: The Alertness feat grants a +2 bonus on Spot checks. Rangers receive a bonus on Spot checks against their favored enemy. Elves gain a +2 bonus on Spot checks, and half-elves gain a +1 bonus.
<br />Use: Spot is part of the Detect modal action. In Passive Detect mode, checks are made automatically every round. Active Detect mode is a modal action that reduces the normal movement rate and makes the character perform an Active Spot, as well as Search and Listen checks.</div>
