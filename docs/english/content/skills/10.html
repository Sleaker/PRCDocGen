<br />Parry allows the character to block incoming attacks and make spectacular counterattacks.
<br />
<br />Check: The DC is the modified attack roll of the incoming blow. A successful Parry check means that the attack does not damage the parrying character. A character may only parry a number of attacks per round equal to the number of attacks per round available to the character.
<br />Special: If the parry is successful and the difference between the roll and the DC is ten points or greater, a counterattack occurs. A counterattack is a free attack made by the parrying character, at his full attack bonus, against the parried opponent. 
<br />Use: Select the Parry mode. The character will remain in parry mode until the mode is exited.</div>
