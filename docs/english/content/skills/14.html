<br />Search is used to detect traps.
<br />
<br />Check: Detecting a trap is an opposed test, pitting the character's Search check against a DC equal to the Set Trap skill check, plus the strength of the trap. Only rogues may detect traps with a DC greater than 35.
<br />
<br />Special: Elves and dwarves receive a +2 bonus to their Search checks, and half-elves gain a +1 bonus.
<br />Use: Search is part of the Detect modal action. In Passive Detect mode, checks are made automatically every round. Active Detect mode is a modal action that reduces the character's normal movement rate and perform an Active Search, as well as Spot and Listen checks.</div>
