<br />
<br />This skill allows a character to place trap kits.
<br />
<br />Check: When a trap kit is used, the character makes a skill check. The DC of the task is determined by the power of the trap.
<br />Special: 5 or more ranks in Disable Traps grants a +2 synergy bonus on Set Trap checks. Any party members are able to see traps that one character has set.
<br />Spectacular Failure: If a skill check is failed by 10 or more, the trap goes off in the attempt to set it. This can only occur if you are in combat when trying to set the trap.
<br />Use: Use a trap kit from your inventory. An icon visible to you and your party will appear on the ground to represent the trap.</div>
