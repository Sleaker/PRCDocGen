			<div>Ability: Dexterity.
<br />Requires Training: No.
<br />Classes: All.
<br />
<br />A character may sneak quietly past an enemy.
<br />
<br />Check: A Move Silently check is opposed by the listening creature's Listen check. If the character is successful, the opposing creature remains unaware as the character moves.
<br />Special: Hide and Move Silently are combined into a single Stealth action. Movement in Stealth mode is slower than the normal rate. Wearing armor inhibits this ability, but low light can provide a bonus.
<br />Use: Select the Stealth action from the Special Abilities radial. Invisible creatures automatically enter Stealth mode.</div>
