<br />The character knows how to create most types of armor, shields and helmets from different materials. 
<br />
<br />How to craft
<br />The character first needs to create the components required for the item he wants to create from base materials (wood, leather, metal, etc).  This can be done by selecting the craft armor option in the material item's radial menu.
<br />
<br />Each item is constructed from two different components (a larger and a smaller one), that need to be assembled in order to finish crafting process.
<br />
<br />To assemble the two components, use the craft armor option in the smaller component's radial menu and target the larger component with it. On a successful Craft Armor skill check, the new item will be created in the character's inventory.  Note that it is not possible to create magic items with your crafting skills. For further information about crafting, please refer to the manual.
