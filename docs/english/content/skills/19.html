<br />Requires Training: Yes.

<br />
<br />A successful Use Magic Device check allows the character to use a magic item as if he had a required class, race, or alignment.
<br />
<br />Check: The base DC is determined by the value of the item, and modified by the type of emulation the character is attempting. If the character attempts to emulate a specific race, the DC increases by 5; if he attempts to emulate a specific alignment, the DC increases by 10. Emulating a specific class does not modify the base DC.
<br />Use: Automatically applied whenever a character attempts to use or equip an item normally unusable by his class, race, or alignment.</div>
