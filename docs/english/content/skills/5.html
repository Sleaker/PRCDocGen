<br />
<br />This skill allows a character to hide from enemies.
<br />
<br />Check: The character must succeed at an opposed test against a searching creature's Spot check. Success means that the character goes undetected.
<br />Special: The Hide and Move Silently skills combine into a single Stealth action. Movement in Stealth mode is slower than the normal rate. Wearing armor or using a torch inhibits this ability, but low light can provide a bonus. A character in Stealth mode is harder to spot if standing still, and if his stature is small.
<br />Use: Select the Stealth action from the Special Abilities radial. Invisible characters automatically enter Stealth mode. Opposed Spot and Listen rolls are made once per round, where applicable.</div>
